Abstract
Purpose of Review In this review, we focus on microbiota modulation using non-digestible carbohydrate and polyphenols (i.e.,
prebiotics) that have the potential to modulate body weight.
Recent Findings Prebiotics derived from plants have gained the interest of public and scientific communities as they may prevent
diseases and help maintain health.
Summary Maintaining a healthy body weight is key to reducing the risk of developing chronic metabolic complications.
However, the prevalence of obesity has increased to pandemic proportions and is now ranked globally in the top five risk factors
for death. While diet and behavioral modification programs aiming to reduce weight gain and promote weight loss are effective in
the short term, they remain insufficient over the long haul as compliance is often low and weight regain is very common. As a
result, novel dietary strategies targeting the gut microbiota have been successful in decreasing obesity and metabolic disorders via
different molecular mechanisms.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity continues to increase dramati-
cally worldwide [ 1] and is considered a major threat to
public health [ 2]. Obesity is associated with low-grade
chronic inflammation, which contributes directly to detri-
mental health consequences such as metabolic disorders
including cardiovascular disea ses, liver steatosis, insulin
resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 3,4]. The precise
etiology of this obesity-related proinflammatory status re-
mains to be fully elucidated, but dysfunction of the adi-
pose tissue has long been regarded as the main culprit [ 5].
Today, it is generally accepted that changes in gut homeo-
stasis could represent anothe r potential source of inflam-
mation. Indeed, over the last few years, the gut
microbiome has been implicated in both beneficial andnegative health outcomes in humans (for review [ 6]).
The gut microbiota refers to t he microbial community that
resides in our intestinal tr act. These inhabitants of the
human body are separated in different phyla. Among
them, the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and
Actinobacteria represent approximately 90% of the micro-
biota, with the remaining portion belonging to the phyla
Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia.
In 2006, a series of seminal papers led by Prof. Jeff
Gordon and colleagues were the first to demonstrate a dif-
ference in the composition of the gut microbiota (i.e., a
shift in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio) and in the
quantity of specific microbial metabolites such as short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) between obese and lean humans
or rodents [ 7,8]. Following these findings, different stud-
ies encouraged a better in-depth analysis of the microbiota
at the taxonomical level (i.e., family, genus, and species).
More recently, disturbances in diversity and composition
of the gut microbiota have been associated with a wide
variety of inflammation-rela ted disorders and pathologies
including metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes
[7,9], inflammatory bowel disease [ 10,11], autoimmune
diseases [ 12], allergy [ 13], and neurological disorders [ 14].
It is now becoming more and more clear that there exist
many host-microbe interactions, mediated through the releaseThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Diabetes and Obesity

of bioactive molecules by bacteria in the gut and absorption of
these metabolites into the circulation. Two key groups of such
metabolites are SCFA, from the fermentation of non-
digestible carbohydrates, and the by-products of polyphenols.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates, Fibers, and Health: A Brief History
The impact of dietary fibers on health has been described over
the last 40 years. Already in 1975, Trowell suggested that the
etiology of type 2 diabetes could come from changes in the
dietary habits and the lack of dietary fibers in the diet. It was
also mentioned that the potential effect of sudden changes in
dietary habits could partly explain the very high prevalence of
diabetes observed in the Pima Indians. These hunter-gatherers
shifted their classical diet —highly rich in non-digestible car-
bohydrates (i.e., fibers) —to a Western diet very low in fibers
and cereal products [ 15]. In 1976, David Jenkins, another
pioneer in this field, published a paper showing that the addi-
tion of non-digestible carbohydrates to the diet (i.e., guar and
pectin fibers) “decreased markedly the rise in blood-glucose
between 30 and 90 minutes also resulted in significantly lower
insulin levels between 30 and 120 minutes ”postprandially
[16]. In these studies, the initial mechanism proposed was
the“gel-forming ”effect and the potential viscosity of the
non-digestible carbohydrates. Indeed, pectin or guar gum
may contribute to the so-called bulking effect (i.e., water re-
tention), which was assumed to be the major mechanism
explaining the effects observed [ 16–18]. Today, the positive
association between non-digestible carbohydrates and health
is undeniable and has been confirmed many times; however, it
appears that their mechanisms of actions are more complex
and cannot be explained merely by their bulking capacity.
Non-digestible Carbohydrates and Microbiota-Derived
Metabolites
With growing insight into the role of non-digestible car-
bohydrates, it has become clear that their fate in the gas-
trointestinal tract is quite different than that of digestible
carbohydrates, which are fully absorbed. Indeed, non-
digestible carbohydrates escape the digestion that occurs
in the first part of the gastrointestinal tract and find their
way to the ileum and the colon, where they are digested
by the gut microbes residing there.
This fermentation of carbohydrates in the lower parts of the
gut is associated with the proliferation or the reduction of
different bacteria but also with the production of several end
products such as the SCFAs (e.g., acetate, butyrate and propi-
onate) (Fig. 1). Although SCFAs have been studied in various
situations and linked with gut health (for review [ 19–21]), it is
worth nothing that those compounds can also reach thecirculation and spread to different peripheric organs (e.g., the
liver, the adipose tissue, the brain [ 22,23]). As a result, they
have been implicated in the regulation of energy, glucose, and
lipid homeostasis and they have also been closely associated
with the regulation of immunity and cancer [ 19]. Thus, these
microbial metabolites have abundant physiological effects.
Non-digestible Carbohydrates, Microbes, and Body Weight
Regulation
The mechanisms explaining how fermented carbohydrate fi-
bers improve metabolism have been initially revealed in ro-
dents by using inulin-type fructans as prebiotics (e.g., inulin or
oligofructose). We and others have contributed to the elucida-
tion of the molecular mechanisms explaining how prebiotic
feeding is associated with a decrease in body weight, fat mass
gain, insulin resistance, and reduced food intake in rodents
with genetic or diet-induced obesity [ 24–28]. Based on the
reasoning of a potential impact of the microbial fermentation
on a gut to brain axis, we discovered that fermentation of
prebiotics leads to the modulation of gut peptides produced
by the L-cells such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
peptide YY (PYY), both involved in the regulation of appe-
tite, body weight, and glucose metabolism [ 29].
Consequently, we found that the endogenous production of
GLP-1 was increased (i.e., higher mRNA expression, peptide
production and secretion, as well as an increase in the number
of producing cells). Hence, the healthier phenotype was linked
to greater GLP-1 and PYY levels in the portal vein blood
[25–27]. Later, this finding was reproduced using resistant
starches or arabinoxylans [ 30–33]. The molecular event
explaining how fermentation increases gut peptides is gener-
ally attributed to the capacity of SCFAs to interact with spe-
cific G protein-coupled receptors such as GPR-43 (also re-
ferred to as FFAR2 for free fatty acid receptor 2) and GPR-
41 (also referred to as FFAR3) [ 34–36]( F i g . 1). Mice with
deletion of these specific receptors are resistant to the benefi-
cial effects of exposure to SCFAs or specific prebiotics and are
characterized by an altered production of GLP-1 and PYY
[37,38,39]. Notably, in humans, we and others reported that
modulation of the microbiome using prebiotics not only in-
creased satiety and reduced hunger and appetite, but also in-
creased the production of GLP-1 and PYY levels in both lean
and obese volunteers [ 40–50]( f o rr e v i e w[ 51]).
In 2018, a very interesting study was published by Liping
Zhao and colleagues wherein they conducted a randomized
clinical study that compared the impact of two isoenergetic
diets that differed in their concentrations of prebiotics on the
modulation of the microbiome [ 52]. In this study, they per-
formed an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms potential-
ly explaining the beneficial effects of a diet rich in fibers;
hence, they analyzed the composition of the gut microbiome
(i.e., taxa and gene functions), the levels of plasma GLP-1 andCurr Nutr Rep (2019) 8:307 –316 308
PYY , and the measurements of SCFAs and other metabolites
such as hydrogen sulfur and indoles. All subjects enrolled
were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and were treated with
acarbose. At the completion of the study (i.e., 84 days), both
groups exhibited a significantly lower level of hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c); however, a greater reduction was observed in
the group that received the high-fiber diet (composed of whole
grains, traditional Chinese medicinal foods, and prebiotics)
than in the control group, which received the usual care and
was administered a diet that followed the normal dietary rec-
ommendations of the Chinese Diabetes Society. Only 50% of
subjects in the control group achieved adequate glycemic con-
trol (i.e., an HbA1c level < 7%), whereas this goal was
reached by 89% of the patients consuming the high-fiber diet.
Similarly, the experimental group achieved greater reductions
in body weight (4.20 ± 0.93% of body weight loss versus 1.45
± 0.91% in the control group).Since the microbial and metabolic profiles of both groups
did not differ at the beginning of the study, the modulation of
the gut microbiome by the fibers was likely to explain the
phenotype. To causally link the different microbial and meta-
bolic profile to the observed phenotype, the authors
transplanted the gut microbiota from the participants into
germ-free mice. Interestingly, when the mice were colonized
with the gut microbiota collected after the dietary interven-
tions, they displayed different metabolic improvements than
mice that were colonized with the microbiota harvested before
the intervention. However, the most interesting finding was
that the mice colonized with the gut microbiota from the pa-
tients treated with the experimental diet also showed lower
fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels than the control
mice. It is worth noting that the beneficial effects were likely
due to the combination of the different fermentable fibers and
plants contained in the diet. Therefore, the synergistic effects

present in food can induce a shift
in the microbial composition and

addition, they can be fermented
into short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) or other metabolites that
can either act locally, on epithelial
cells and their receptors, or enter
the blood circulation. SCFAs can
activate receptors GPR41/43 and
thereby increase GLP-1 and PYY
hormone levels, while
metabolites from polyphenols are
able to activate AMPK in a broad
range of tissues. Ultimately, both
pathways result in the activation
of cellular programs that favor the
release of energy and promote
energy expenditureCurr Nutr Rep (2019) 8:307 –316 309
observed are probably resulting from the impact on the micro-
biota of both, the sources of non-digestible carbohydrates and
the different polyphenolic compounds (discussed in the next
chapter of this review). These observations led the authors to
conclude that the changes in the microbiome induced by in-
creasing the consumption of non-digestible carbohydrates
were sufficient to improve the metabolic parameters of pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes. Among the mechanisms, here
again the levels of SCFAs correlated with improvements in
several metabolic parameters, such as lower glycemia, blood
lipid levels, and fat mass, as well as increased blood levels of
GLP-1 and PYY [ 52].
Although this study and other related studies have correlat-
ed the abundance of SCFAs and gut peptides with metabolic
effects, researchers have not yet been able to completely as-
certain whether the duo of SCFAs and gut hormones
completely explain the observed results in humans.
Polyphenols
Polyphenols and Health
The first definition of prebiotics —a non-digestible food ingre-
dient that beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulat-
ing the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of
bacteria in the colon, and thus improves host health [ 53]—was
tailored to fibers. However, based on a fast-growing body of
literature, this definition has continued to evolve over time
[54], with the latest consensus being that a prebiotic is a sub-
strate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms con-
ferring a health benefit, thus expanding the concept to also
include non-carbohydrate substances [ 55]. Indeed, some
beneficial microbes also gain proliferating advantages from
other compounds that are not covered by the initial description
of a prebiotic. Polyphenols fall into this category.
Polyphenols constitute a large heterogenous family of over
8000 phytochemicals characterized by hydroxylated phenyl
moieties [ 56]. They are classified based on their chemical
structure and complexity (i.e., the number of phenolic rings
and substituting groups), but generally they are broken down
into two categories: flavonoids and non-flavonoids [ 57]. Non-
flavonoids include phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans.
Flavonoids are further divided into subclasses including fla-
vanones, flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, flavanols,
anthocyanidins, isoflavones, and proanthocyanidins.
Polyphenols are bioactive compounds that are second only
to carbohydrates when it comes to abundancy in plants, where
they have a protective role against, for example, damage from
UV radiation and pathogens.
Although they have been used in traditional medicine
for a long time, we are only now beginning to understand
their mechanisms of action and accumulating literature is
demonstrating that the consumption of polyphenol richfoods and beverages such as tea, coffee, fruits, vegetables,
cereals, and wine could benefit human health. It is sug-
gested that various polyphenols possess properties that
could have preventive and/or therapeutic effects for car-
diovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer,
allergies, diabetes, and obesity [ 58–60].
Polyphenols and Obesity
T h e r ea r es e v e r a li nv i v os t u d i e s ,b o t hi na n i m a l sa n di n
humans that suggest a negative association between polyphe-
nol intake and body weight [ 58,60,61,62–64,65,66].
Perhaps the best-studied polyphenols in this context are the
polyphenols from green tea [ 67,68]. Green tea is the dried
leaves of Camellia sinensis plants. It contains the highest
amounts of phenolic compounds and exhibits the highest an-
tioxidant capabilities of any major tea type. It is rich in flavo-
noids (e.g., catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epi-
gallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidins). Of these, epi-
gallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is considered the most signifi-
cant active component. EGCG has been attributed antioxi-
dant, anti-inflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties and is
thought to help prevent weight gain [ 63,67–70].
Besides (green) tea, many other sources of polyphenols
have been studied for their potential preventive and therapeu-
tic properties [ 63,65]. Coffee is rich in 3-caffeoylquinic acid,
fruits such as blueberries have anthocyanins, red grapes and
wine are a source of resveratrol, and spice like turmeric con-
tains curcumin. All of these foods have been inversely asso-
ciated with the metabolic syndrome and BMI in epidemiolog-
ical studies [ 60].
Itis important to note that some human epidemiologi-
cal studies have shown inconsistent results. This may in-
dicate that the benefits of polyphenols may depend on the
method of administration or on the population studied
[63,65]. Also, the number of interventional studies pro-
viding direct evidence for these associations are still few,
use relatively low doses of specific polyphenols, and oc-
c u ro v e ras h o r tp e r i o do ft i m e[ 65].
Mechanisms of Action of Polyphenols
How polyphenols exert their beneficial effects in the context
of obesity is still a matter of debate. Polyphenols possess
electron-donating phenolic groups in their structures, which
allow them to locally prevent cellular damage caused by reac-
tive oxygen species in the intestinal tract. However, although
their antioxidant capacity is often cited, recent research sug-
gests this is not the major cause for their effects on body fat
accumulation [ 67]. A number of polyphenols have been
shown to reduce nutrient intake in the gastrointestinal tract
by interacting with and inhibiting digestive enzymes, thereby
hampering starch, lipid, and protein digestion and absorptionCurr Nutr Rep (2019) 8:307 –316 310
to reduce energy efficiency [ 71–76]. Other potential mecha-
nisms of action include reduction of inflammation, modu-
lation of glucose homeostasis, suppression of adipogenesis
and lipid synthesis, increase of energy expenditure via
thermogenesis, stimulation of fat oxidation, and excretion
of fecal lipids [ 60,61,62,77,78]. The precise underlying
molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. One pos-
sibility, the so-called “AMPK hypothesis ”proposed by
Yang et al., is that the polyphenols activate AMPK (aden-
osine monophosphate-activ ated protein kinase) [ 61,79].
This “master switch ”is ubiquitously expressed and serves
as the master metabolic molecule that regulates how cells
process energy, making it a heavily pursued target for treat-
ment of metabolic diseases [ 80,81]. Polyphenols have
b e e ns h o w ni nv i v oa n di nv i t r ot oa c t i v a t eA M P K .
Polyphenols and Microbiota
Most polyphenols, however, display poor bioavailability.
They are not well absorbed in the small intestine [ 82]a n d
are rapidly metabolized and excreted in urine and feces.
However, when reaching the colon, they come in direct
contact with the gut microbes, resulting in a complex and
multidirectional interaction.
First, the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols ensures the
protection of the colonic epithelial and mucosa architecture
and shapes the environment in which gut microbes can thrive
[83]. Second, since the vast majority of the polyphenols reach
the colon almost unaltered, they are able to modify the intes-
tinal microbiota, possibly affecting its capacity for energy har-
vest, and contributing to the improvement of health [ 84,85].
As a major source of nutrients for some microbes residing in
the colon, polyphenols may also act as prebiotics and favor the
growth of specific species [ 83,86–91]. In addition, polyphe-
nols may be involved in the adhesion of probiotic bacteria to
the intestinal epithelia [ 92,93]. This could be important for
their colonization and for their subsequent efficacy to exert
physiological effects [ 94].
Third, polyphenols are subjected to catabolism by the mi-
crobiota and are degraded into low molecular weight bioactive
compounds that are more easily absorbed through the intesti-
nal barrier and are capable of exerting effects in peripheric
organs [ 86,95–98]. Perhaps the best known metabolites are
the phenolic acids, to which several potential health benefits
have been attributed, such as anti-microbial activities, anti-
inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, reinforcement of
the gut barrier, and also for regulating cyclooxygenase 2 ac-
tivity [ 99,100]. Interestingly, it has been suggested that poly-
phenols may also be able to induce the production of SCFAs
bycolonic bacteria [ 67,101–104]. This occurs either by the
growth promotion of SCFA-producing bacteria (prebiotic ef-
fect), or by stimulation of their metabolic functions [ 105].
Finally, the intrinsic toxicity of the phenolic group givespolyphenols antibacterial activity [ 106–108]. As this may pre-
vent biofilm formation and favor some bacterial species above
others this feature allows polyphenols to further impact the
microbial composition [ 109].
Although short-term animal studies clearly showed an ef-
fect of polyphenols on gut microbiota composition and obesi-
ty [110–114], it remains to be established whether these
changes are significant enough to explain, at least in part,
the health benefits of polyphenols in the long-term in human
populations. For example, it has been described how the long-
term supplementation of green tea did not change the gut
microbiota in humans [ 115].
Polyphenols and Akkermansia muciniphila
Akkermansia muciniphila is a Gram-negative mucin-
degrading bacterium that, in contrast to most other gut
microbes, resides within the mucus layer that covers the
gut. It makes up 1 –5% of the microbes in a healthy hu-
man gut, but its abundance is strongly reduced in the
intestine of obese individuals. A. muciniphila is inversely
associated with obesity, diabetes, cardiometabolic dis-
eases, and low-grade inflamma tion, and the supplementa-
tion with A. muciniphila has been linked to beneficial
effects in a variety of preclinical models [ 116–118].
In 2014, a study demonstrated that a polyphenol-rich cran-
berry extract prevented weight gain and ameliorated several
features of the metabolic syndrome in diet-induced obese mice
[111]. This was associated with a strong increase in the abun-
dance of A. muciniphila in the gut microbiota. The exact
mechanisms behind this increase are not known, but interest-
ingly, it was shown that cranberry proanthocyanidins are also
associated with an increase in the production of mucus, a
major energy source for these mucin-degrading bacteria
[119]. The increase in Akkermansia was later also observed
in experiments that used extracts from grapes, that, like
berries, contain abundant proanthocyanidins [ 85,120], and
also in studies using other types of berries and polyphenols
[84,121–124]. This suggests that polyphenols may exert at
least part of their beneficial effects via a prebiotic effect on
certain bacteria such as Akkermansia .
Polyphenols as an Anti-obesity Drug
The amplitude of the anti-obesity effects in humans will prob-
ably depend on many factors. Beside the classical interindi-
vidual variations (genetics and differences in gut microbiota
composition), other factors such as how and when polyphe-
nols are administered, may play a role. Since polyphenols and
fibers share common plant-based sources, they are often con-
sumed together. Interactions between polyphenols and poly-
saccharides are therefore inevitable. These interactions can
have profound consequenc es on the extractability,Curr Nutr Rep (2019) 8:307 –316 311
bioavailability, functional characteristics, and on the fermen-
tation kinetics of dietary fibers and/or polyphenols [ 125]. A
study by Edwards et al. [ 126] aims at exploring this interplay
and may lead to new product designs that further optimize the
positive actions of dietary fibers and polyphenols. For exam-
ple, because fibers are fermented, they may selectively in-
crease the activity of specific bacteria which in turn may
potentialize the presence of bacteria responsible for polyphe-
nol catabolism. Moreover, polyphenols may also influence the
fermentation of the fibers as numerous polyphenols exhibit
both anti-microbial and prebiotic effects. Therefore, under-
standing the complex interaction between both dietary fibers
and polyphenolic compounds will pave the way for designing
future nutritional composition or food combination with an
optimal health benefit [ 126].
Another critical factor is dosage. It is important to achieve
high enough levels to have an effect, but overconsumption of
polyphenols may not be without risk and caution is advised
when preparing concentrated extracts [ 127,128].
The anti-obesity effects of polyphenols may be further en-
hanced by habitual exercise [ 129,130]. In vitro data suggest
that catechins inhibit the enzyme catechol-O-
methyltransferase (COMT). This enzyme is partially respon-
sible for the breakdown of norepinephrine, which is involved
in the mobilization of fat from adipose tissues. If the lipids that
are liberated are not maximally utilized by increasing physical
a c t i v i t y ,t h e yw i l lb es t o r e da g a i n ,a t t e n u a t i n gt h ea n t i - o b e s i t y
effects; however, whether this mechanism may explain the
in vivo effects remains controversial [ 131].
Conclusion
While the obesity problem is often reduced to a simple math-
ematical imbalance between energy intake and energy expen-
diture, understanding how it develops and progresses is a
complex problem that requires comprehension of multiple ge-
netic, biologic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.
Countering its advance will require multidisciplinary and in-
novative approaches, combining dietary and behavioral
changes with nutritional or therapeutic supplements, if need-
ed. One of the components that can directly influence the
outcome of such strategies is the gut microbiota. Indeed, the
microbial community that colonizes the border between lu-
men of the gut and the inside of the body plays a decisive role
in the host metabolism.
Non-digestible carbohydrates and polyphenols, two types of
substrates that are metabolized by the gut microbes, represent
an interesting set of tools to bend the microbiota to our advan-
tage because they can modify the gut microbiota composition
and be converted by the microbiota into useful metabolites.
Which fibers or polyphenols will prove the most suited to max-
imize beneficial effects will probably depend on the specificsituation and the individual (and its microbiota). While we have
gained a lot of insights regarding the effects and mechanism of
actions of these promising compounds, further investigations
are still warranted in order to design optimal associations of
compounds according to the health benefit expected, that is
improving weight management, as well as glucose metabolism
or even anti-inflammatory properties.
