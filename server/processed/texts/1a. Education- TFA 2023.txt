“A distressing  feature  in the life of which  you are about 
to enter….is  the uncertainty  which  pertains  not alone 
to our science  and art, but also to the very hopes  and 
fears which  make  us people.  In seeking  out the absolute 
truth we aim at the unattainable, and must be content 
with finding  broken  portions”  — Sir William  Osler1

Ambiguity  Risk UNDERSTANDING TOLERANCE FOR AMBIGUITY: A CATALYST FOR DECISION MAKING  
 
 
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, CLINICAL  
practices, and non-healthcare businesses 
have  suggested  that successful  enterprises 
must  be capable  of tolerating  uncertainty.2 
Because physical therapy healthcare 
businesses are challenged by uncertain 
political leadership, changing economic 
markets, and volatile global  healthcare 
patterns (pandemics, reimbursement), 
there  is value  in 1) recruiting  people  
who already have an innate but healthy 
tolerance  for uncertainty,  and 2) developing 
people  in the workforce  who  can tolerate 
uncertainty. The challenge is that the 
word “uncertainty” is a ubiquitous 
phenomenon,  not easily  defined,  may  
be a “trait”  or a “state  of mind,”  and not 
an easy construct to understand and 
act upon.2 Despite  the broad  framework  
defining uncertaint y, entrepreneurs strive 
to teach future business leaders how to 
tolerate uncertainty as it is viewed as 
essential for success.3,4 
The purposes of this article are to 
clarify the difference between uncertainty 
and ambiguity, offer an example of how 
toleranc e for ambiguity is measured,  
and discuss evidence supporting that   
 
tolerance for ambiguity may be modifiable 
and important to healthcare practitioners.  
UNCERTAINTY VERSUS 
AMBIGUITY  
Uncertainty is the “metacognitive 
awareness of ignorance” and is often 
inappropriately interchanged with words 
like “ambiguity.”  Indeed,  the three  main 
overlapping contributors to uncertainty 
are 1) ambiguity,  2) probability  (risk),  and 
3) complexity (Figure 1).1,5,6 Ambiguity 
pertains to managing with incomplete 
or unreliable information. Risk is what 
you know about a situation based on 
probability,  but you are not sure  if taking  
that risk (%) is worth  the potential  reward. 
Complexity  is a lack of knowledge  about 
a given  topic  because  it is too difficult  
or beyond  the scope  of understanding. 
All three components contribute to 
uncertainty, but poor tolerance for 
ambiguity  among  healthcare  workers 
is known  to be associated  with  lesser  
empathy, greater burnout, and increased 
psychological distress.6-9 For these 
reasons, we will foc us this article on 
tolerance for ambiguity (TfA).

As previously  stated,  ambiguity  exists  when  decisions 
need  to be made  despite  missing  information  (evidence) 
or the available information pertinent to the decision 
lacks  credibility,  reliability,  or validity.1,5,6,10  While  lack of 
information is frustrating when a decision needs to be 
made,  it is the reality  in healthcare,  and is not always  well 
simulated  in academic  training  programs.  A longstanding 
focus  on “getting  the right  answer  on a test”  rather  than 
getting a “creative answer on a test” may theoretically 
compromise the development of TfA.11 The owner of a 
private  practice  lives  in an everchanging  environment  
making  the “best  answer”  a fluid  construct  that is dependent 
on factors  that are often  unknown  or beyond  their  control.  
The astute  business  owner  would  likely  prefer  to hire people 
that have  a healthy  capacity  to tolerate  ambiguity  and would 
welcome information on whether they can teach people to 
become more tolerant of ambiguity. A “healthy” tolerance 
for ambiguity  is ideal;  recognizing  that too much  or too little 
tolerance  becomes  problematic.  The challenge  to leadership 
in private  practices  settings  is to develop  measurements  to 
help  us manage.  This  raises  the question  as to whether  our 
private  practice  environment  promotes  the development  of 
TfA among staff as they pursue “creative solutions,” or do 
they extinguish TfA among staff as they pursue the “right 
answer”? We cannot answer these questions without a 
sound method to measure  TfA.  
MEASURING TOLERANCE FOR 
AMBIGUITY (TFA)  
A recent  systematic  review  and meta -analysis  revealed 
four scales suitable to assess tolerance for ambiguity.12 
One of those scales that is workable, psychometrically 
sound, and efficiently deployed was developed by  Geller 
and colleagues.13 This  tool was adopted  by our academic  department several years ago to understand the TfA of 
physical therapy students matriculating at the University of 
Iowa  and later  as a metric  in a national  benchmarking  trial.14-16 
The test battery  consists  of seven  items  that are scored  on a 
Likert  scale  to learn  about  a person’s  TfA.  
Generally, people who are uncomfortable with ambiguity, 
as measured by these items, are believed to perceive 
ambiguous situations as a source of threat and not an 
opportunity to be creative and/or learn somethi ng new.2 
Results from our own national physical therapy 
benchmarking study support that Doctor of Physical 
Therapy  Students  who  show  higher  TfA scores  report  less 
exhaustion,  greater  empathy,  and greater  satisfaction  with 
their career choice of becoming a physical therapist.9,16 
Trends in our national data suggest that TfA may vary 
based on intentions to seek specialist training and even 
varies  among  those  who  may  seek  certain  specialty  areas  of 
physical  therapy  practi ce (Table  1). While  these  datasets  are 
still being  developed,  they  illustrate  how  measurement  can 
enhance  our ability  to assess  if graduates  from  our program 
deviate or are congruent with the aggregate benchmarks 
from  a large  sample  of programs  nationwide.  
A recent report affirmed that TfA may change as a 
function of the work environment. Specifically, medical 
school students who, at the time of admission, had high 
TfA scores  regressed  to lower  TfA scores  upon  graduation; 
while  those  with  lower  TfA scores  elevated  their  TfA scores 
upon  graduation.11 The importance  of this finding  is that it 
confirms  that TfA is mutable  and may  not be a “fixed  trait” 
but rather  a more  malleable  “state  of mind.”  Whether  our 
clinical  physical  therapy  culture  reinforces  those  with  high 
TfA with  creative  opportunities  is not known.  The need  to 
benchmark with common data elements, like TfA, across the

scores  across  “intended”  areas  of practice  for physical  therapy  graduates  nationwide.  It is important  to note that graduates 
were not limited  in choice  of one specialty.

signatures  of clinical  practices  that promote  creativity  and 
TfA within their own  environment.  
ENTREPRENEURIAL THINKING: 
TEACHING TOLERANCE  FOR 
AMBIGUITY  
Entrepreneurial skillsets, which includes tolerance for 
ambiguity, are now being offered in business education 
programs around the country.4 Their goal is to teach 
students  to accept  uncertainty  without  losing  motivation. 
For students,  ambiguity  triggers  a cognitive,  emotional,  and 
behavioral reaction that presents as discomfort, anxiety, 
and then avoidance of the triggering situation or event.4 
Exposing students to ambiguous conditions, discussing 
their perceived response, and discussing what they are 
experiencing  in the present  and what  they  fear in the 
future  is offered  as the basis  for advancing  tolerance  skills. 
While there are limited randomized research trials that 
scientifically  show  the impact  of this pedagogy  on improving 
workforce  tolerance  for ambiguity,  a recent  report  did show 
that exposing  people  to “creative  options”  fosters  a greater 
tolerance  when  dealing  with  ambiguous  information.3 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
Tolerance  for uncertainty  is a broader  construct  than  just 
tolerance  for ambiguity.  Through  this review,  and,  based 
on our work  in measuring  TfA among  academic  programs 
nationwide,  we suggest  that all practices,  including  those 
in the private  practice  section,  would  receive  help  from  a 
national  benchmark  to better  understand  the staff’s  TfA.  
Once TfA is measured in clinical practice, interventions 
such  as those  that are part of the entrepreneurial  pedagogy, 
designed  to develop  certain  skillsets,  may  be deployed,  and 
assessed.  The immediate  “take  home  messages”  are that 
1) TfA is just one arm of the uncertainty  complex  but is 
associated  with  factors  needed  by physical  therapists;  
2) TfA can be assessed with a workable and 
psychometrically  sound  measurement  tool;  and 3) TfA 
is malleable  in both  directions  and should  likely  be an 
important  element  to developing  physical  therapists 
working  in all areas  of clinical  practice.
