SUMMARY AND CONCLIJSIONS 
I. The goal of this study was to characterize the fatigability, 
contractile relaxation properties, electrophysiological responses, 
and histochemical properties of the human paralyzed soleus muscle 
to determine its relative plasticity. 
2. Acute ( <6 wk, y2 = 3) and chronic ( > 1 yr, y2 = 10) paralyzed 
individuals had the tibia1 nerve activated with a 20-Hz square wave 
delivered for 330 ms every second for 4 min. The soleus muscle 
peak torque, one-half relaxation time ( ‘/,RT), normalized maxi- 
mum rate of relaxation (nMRR), and mass muscle action-potential 
amplitude (M wave) were computed every 30 s. A soleus muscle 
biopsy was evaluated for myosin adenosine triphosphatase enzyme 
( ATPase; pH 9.4,4.6, and 4.2) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- 
tide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) . 
3. In the chronically paralyzed group the torque was signifi- 
cantly reduced within 30 s of the fatigue protocol. The ‘/,RT and 
nMRR were also significantly changed within 30 s, supporting 
that muscle relaxation was prolonged. No significant changes were 
present at comparable times during the same 4-min fatigue protocol 
applied to the acutely paralyzed soleus muscle. M-wave amplitude 
was significantly reduced in the chronic group, but only at 3 min 
of the fatigue protocol. Conversely, no significant changes occurred 
to the M waves of the acute group. 
4. The correlation was high between torque and nMRR (Y = 
0880.97) and torque and ‘/?RT (r = 0.88-0.96) for each chronic 
subject. A close association was also found between 1/,RT and 
nMRR (Y = 0.88-0.92) for each chronic subject. Because these 
variables changed minimally in the acutely paralyzed group, a 
lower correlation was present (~ r = 0.45-0.52). 
5. Torque was weakly correlated to M-wave amplitude (r = 
0.55) for the chronically paralyzed group. The greatest change in 
torque occurred at a time (O-65 s) when the least amount of 
change occurred in the M-wave amplitude, suggesting that the 
source of fatigue was within the contractile mechanism and not 
attributable to neuromuscular transmission compromise. 
6. Despite a close association between torque and relaxation 
properties during fatigue of the chronically paralyzed soleus mus- 
cle, there was a significant dissociation after 5 min of recovery. 
Torque recovered to 60%, whereas the relaxation properties were 
consistently fully recovered. This suggests that the mechanism 
causing torque reduction covaried with the mechanism leading to 
prolonged relaxation during fatigue, but during recovery the two 
mechanisms no longer covaried. M-wave amplitude was also com- 
pletely recovered at 5 min despite continued torque depression. 
7. Qualitative histochemical analysis supported that >90% of 
the sampled chronically paralyzed soleus muscle was comprised 
of type II fibers (myosin ATPase-9.4) and had reduced oxidative 
capacity (NADH-TR). The type II fibers were found to be predom- 
inantly type IIB (myosin ATPase: 4.6, 4.2). 
8. Fatigability, relaxation properties, and histochemical analysis 
supports that the chronically paralyzed soleus muscle functions 
and stains qualitatively as a composite of type IIB muscle fibers. 
Conversely, within 6 wk of paralysis, the fatigability and relaxation property changes were minimal in the human soleus muscle as 
would be expected in a predominantly slow muscle. The human 
chronically paralyzed soleus muscle appears to be more fatigable 
than that reported for the paralyzed soleus muscle in animal models 
at a comparable time period after spinal cord disruption. 
INTRODUCTION 
When the human spinal cord is damaged, the resulting 
paralyzed skeletal musculature undergoes significant adapta- 
tions. Evidence that type I fatigue-resistant fibers [low-den- 
sity myosin adenosine triphosphatase enzyme ( ATPase ) ] 
transform into type II (high-density myosin ATPase) fibers 
in cats (Alaimo et al. 1984; Baldwin et al. 1984; Mayer et 
al. 1984; Roy et al. 1984), rats (Lieber et al. 1986), guinea 
pigs ( Karpati and Engel 1968), and humans (Grimby et 
al. 1976) after spinal cord transection is well documented. 
However, the effect of long-term paralysis on skeletal mus- 
cle fatigability is less understood. 
After spinal cord disruption, postural muscles comprised 
of predominantly type I muscle fibers showed a limited abil- 
ity to transform to fast fatigable (FF) fibers (IIB) (Baldwin 
et al. 1984; Cope et al. 1986; Jiang et al. 1990; Karpati et 
al. 1968). This limited plasticity supported the notion that 
chronically paralyzed postural muscles (soleus) maintained 
their fatigue-resistant properties despite taking on character- 
istics of faster muscle (Baldwin et al. 1984; Cope et al. 
1986). The altered interaction between nerve and muscle 
after spinal cord disruption is believed to influence the iso- 
myosin expression in slow muscle fibers (Baldwin et al. 
1989) leading to faster muscle contractile properties (myosin 
ATPase) but minimal effects on the oxidative capacitv and - 
fatigability (Jiang et al. 1990). 
Previous reports suggest that similar discrepancies exist 
between transformed muscle fiber type (type I to type II) 
and fatigability in studies on cross reinnervation (Buller et 
al. 1960; Chan et al. 1982), and reduced activity studies 
induced by casting ( Witzmann et al. 1983)) tenotomy ( Bag- 
ust 1979), pinning (Maier et al. 1976)) and hindlimb suspen- 
sion (Corley et al. 1984). 
Evidence that soleus muscle type I (oxidative) to type 
IIA (fast oxidative glycolytic) conversions have not pro- 
ceeded to IIB (fast glycolytic) in paralyzed animal models 
further supports the limited plasticity of type I fibers in pos- 
tural muscle (Baldwin et al. 1984; Cope et al. 1986; Jiang 
et al. 1990; Karpati and Engel 1968; for review see Gordon 
and Pattullo 1993). This notion is further supported by the 
long-term paralyzed cat soleus muscle, which shows mini- 
mal or no change in muscle fatigability even 1 yr after spinal

transection (Baldwin et al. 1984). The maintained fatigue 
resistance for the soleus muscle after long-term spinalization 
in animal models has been regarded as one of the most 
striking examples of physiological resistance to change and 
has been assumed to also be true for human postural muscle 
( soleus) (Gordon and Pattullo 1993 ) . 
However, Grimby and colleagues ( 1976) found the hu- 
man chronically paralyzed soleus muscle to be comprised 
of predominantly type IIB fibers with the use of qualitative 
histochemistry [ myosin ATPase, nicotinamide adenine dinu- 
cleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR)] , but no physio- 
logical studies of fatigability were examined. This raises 
the question as to whether the human chronically paralyzed 
soleus, a postural muscle, retains its resistance to fatigue as 
the result of chronic spinal transection, especially in lieu 
of the qualitative histochemical evidence demonstrating the 
presence of type IIB fibers (Grimby et al. 1976). Interest- 
ingly, the human soleus muscle, with its normal predomi- 
nance of type I fibers (Johnson et al. 1973)) has never been 
repetitively activated to study its fatigability in humans with 
paralysis despite the extensive reports on the paralyzed so- 
leus muscle in other species. Whether the human paralyzed 
soleus muscle will maintain its fatigue-resistant properties 
is unknown. If the human paralyzed soleus muscle becomes 
highly fatigable, it may suggest a greater plasticity than that 
previously found in similar paralyzed postural muscles of 
other species. 
The duration of paralysis may be an important factor de- 
termining the extent to which paralyzed muscle transforms. 
Longer periods of inactivity may contribute to more com- 
plete muscle fiber transformation leading to related histo- 
chemical and physiological (fatigue) properties. Cope and 
colleagues ( 1986) found that the population of soleus motor 
units showed decreased contraction and relaxation times, 
decreased after hyperpolarization, increased incidence of 
sag, and an increase in the rheobase and axonal conduction 
velocity (all properties of faster motor units), but no change 
in fatigability 4 mo after spinal transection in the cat. Con- 
versely, Munson and colleagues ( 1986) found the percent- 
age of FF motor units in the gastrocnemius muscle to be 
increased within 2 wk after spinal cord transection of the cat, 
with no further changes noted over the next 7 mo. Whether 
Cope and colleagues ( 1986) would have found their reported 
changes before 4 mo or more extensive changes leading to 
increased fatigability beyond 4 mo is not known. Conse- 
quently, the present study compared the fatigability of the 
human acutely (within 6 wk of spinal transection) paralyzed 
soleus muscle to the chronically paralyzed soleus muscle to 
assist in determining whether human soleus muscle adapta- 
tions are immediate after spinal cord transection. 
Other muscle physiological changes should be apparent 
if the human paralyzed soleus muscle transforms to FF fibers. 
For example, prolongation of muscle contractile properties 
is closely associated with fatigue of FF motor units (Dubose 
et al. 1987; Gordon et al. 1990; Rankin et al. 1988) and 
whole muscle comprised of type IIB fibers (Kernel1 et al. 
1987). If the human chronically paralyzed soleus muscle 
responds as a composite of highly fatigable muscle fibers, 
then significant prolongation of the relaxation properties dur- 
ing the fatigue protocol would be expected (Dubose et al. 
1987 ) . As importantly, understanding the contractile prop- erty changes during fatigue of human paralyzed muscle may 
have clinical significance because optimal electrical stimula- 
tion frequency has been found to be closely coupled to mus- 
cle contractile properties (Bigland-Ritchie et al. 1983; Big- 
land-Ritchie and Woods 1984; Kukulka et al. 1986; Woods 
et al. 1987). 
Increased soleus muscle fatigability may suggest compro- 
mised neuromuscular transmission (Fahim and Robbins 
1986; Krnjevic and Miledi 1958; Pagala et al. 1984) and 
not necessarily reflect the muscle contractile machinery 
properties. Monitoring soleus muscle compound muscle ac- 
tion potentials (M waves) during the stimulation protocol 
ensures that adequate activation of the muscle occurs. Fur- 
thermore, a dissociation between M-wave amplitude and 
force during muscle fatigue suggests that force failure is 
beyond the neuromuscular transmission system (Enoka et al. 
1989; Pagala et al. 1984). Conversely, a parallel reduction in 
M-wave amplitude and force is consistent with the all-or- 
none response associated with neuromuscular transmission 
compromise (Enoka et al. 1989; Pagala et al. 1984). 
In general, the classification of motor unit (Burke et al. 
1973; Burke and Tsairis 1974) and whole muscle properties 
(Barany 1967; Kernel1 et al. 1987; Peter et al. 1972) support 
that a close association typically exists between histochemi- 
cal fiber type (myosin ATPase) and fatigability. Conse- 
quently, this study also evaluated the myosin ATPase density 
in conjunction with physiological studies of fatigue of the 
human paralyzed soleus muscle. 
The purposes of this study were to I ) report the fatigability 
and relaxation properties of the human acutely (within 6 wk 
of transection) and chronically ( 2 1 yr) paralyzed soleus 
muscle during repetitive activation and recovery, 2) describe 
the relationship between the relaxation properties and torque 
during repetitive activation of the human paralyzed soleus 
muscle, 3) determine the extent that neuromuscular trans- 
mission (M waves) contributes to paralyzed muscle fatigue, 
and 4) reassess, through qualitative histochemistry, the fiber 
type distribution of one representative example of the human 
chronically paralyzed soleus muscle. 
A preliminary report of some of these results has been 
made in abstract form (Shields 1992a). 
METHODS 
Instrumentation 
The torque measurement system was designed to measure the 
plantarflexion torque with a subject in the seated position with the 
knee and ankle at 90’. Adjustability of the heel cup, force trans- 
ducer, and axis of rotation allowed the force transducer (AWU- 
250, Genisco technology) to be positioned under the first metatarsal 
head. The foot plate axis of rotation was aligned with the anatomic 
axis of the ankle. Stabilization of the heel to the foot plate during 
torque production was provided by a rigid ankle cuff directing 
three vectors of force through the calcaneus via turnbuckles. A 
double strap secured over the femur provided further stabilization 
of the heel in the foot plate assembly during plantarflexion. Figure 
1 shows a schematic of the torque measurement system. Calibration 
of the torque measurement system with known loads yielded a 
linear regression equation with an R’ value of 0.99. Linearity, 
hysteresis, repeatability, and accuracy of the entire measurement 
system was 1.10, 1.22, 0.430, and 1.3 1% full scale, respectively. 
The force transducer was electronically coupled to a multichannel

signal amplification and processing system with gain range from 
10 to 1,000, and a frequency response from DC to 1,000 Hz (FPM- 
67, Therapeutics Unlimited). 
Bipolar silver-silver chloride surface electrodes with a l-cm 
diam and fixed 2-cm interelectrode distance were used to monitor 
the M wave from the soleus muscle. Others (Gravel et al. 1987; 
Kimura 1989; Kukulka et al. 1986) have previously reported ade- 
quate representation of the soleus muscle electrical activity with 
surface electrodes. An additional electrode was placed over the 
tibialis anterior muscle to visually monitor any inadvertent peroneal 
nerve activation. The signal from all electrodes was on-site pream- 
plified by a factor of 35 before mainframe amplification. The signal 
was differentially amplified [input impedance, 15 MO at 100 Hz; 
frequency response, 40-4,000 Hz; common mode rejection ratio 
(cmrr) = 87 db at 60 Hz] and had a gain of l,OOO- 100,000 times. 
A constant current stimulator and isolation unit (custom de- 
signed) had a current range from 50 PA to 75 mA with current 
variations of <5% and total voltage capability of 600 V. The stimulator was triggered by a digital timer from another stimulator 
(Grass model S-l 1). Stimulation was delivered via a double- 
pronged stimulation electrode secured over the tibia1 nerve with 
the use of an orthoplast splint. 
The torque, electromyographic signals, and stimulus pulses were 
monitored on the oscilloscope and stored on a FM recorder (Vetter 
model D). The recorder had a frequency response of DC-2,500 
Hz at a tape speed of 3.75 in/s. Off-line analysis was performed 
by a microcomputer via an analog-to-digital converter (Das 16F, 
Metrabyte) with a 12-bit resolution. 
Recording procedures 
SUBJECTS. Thirteen completely paralyzed individuals were stud- 
ied. Ten of the subjects had sustained a complete spinal cord injury 
at least 1 yr before testing, whereas three of the subjects had 
sustained a complete spinal cord injury no longer than 6 wk before 
testing. The completeness of the injury was determined by an ex- 
tensive neurological examination that included an assessment of 
sharp-dull distinction, motor function, and position sense testing 
below the level of the spinal lesion. A lesion was considered com- 
plete if all three modalities tested (sharp-dull distinction, position 
sense, and muscle strength) were absent during these tests. Of the 
10 chronic subjects studied, 8 were males and 2 were females. 
Five subjects had no neurological function below the sixth cervical 
level, three below the fourth thoracic level, and one below the 
eighth thoracic level. All acute subjects were males with no neuro- 
logical function below the fifth cervical, second thoracic, and sev- 
enth thoracic level, respectively. All subjects had at least 5’ of 
passive ankle dorsiflexion and a full 20’ of plantarflexion. No 
secondary medical complications were present in any subjects. All 
subjects were informed of their rights and signed consent forms 
before participation. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics 
(means t SD) for all subjects involved in the study. 
The skin over the soleus muscle was scrubbed with alcohol, and 
the electrode was applied -2 cm lateral to the midline at one-third 
the distance from the lateral malleolus to the fibular head. After 
visual inspection of the M waves, the electrode was slightly reposi- 
tioned in four subjects to accentuate the biphasic waveform. Each 
subject had the right foot placed in the torque measuring device 
and secured so that the ankle was at 90’. The subject’s wheelchair 
was rolled forward until the knee was also flexed to 90”. The 
majority of the plantarflexion torque generated in this position is 
attributed to the soleus muscle (Sale et al. 1982; Shields 1992b). 
The stimulator was set to deliver a 0.5- to I-ms pulse at 1 
Hz for 1 min to the tibia1 nerve. The stimulation intensity was 
progressively increased until the maximum M wave was reached. 
The stimulator was incremented a minimum of two times the maxi- 
mal intensity to ensure supramaximal activation. Next, a modified 
Burke fatigue protocol (Burke et al. 1973) consisting of a 20-Hz 
burst for 330 ms administered every second for 4 min was deliv- 
ered. Modifying this protocol from 40 Hz and extending it to 4 
min was found to be necessary from many pilot experiments. First, 
there was an increased incidence of muscle spasm during 40-Hz 
stimulation. Second, extensive prolongation of the muscle relax- 
ation properties during 40-Hz stimulation prevented the torque 
from returning to baseline between trains. Third, the 20-Hz stimula- 
tion over 330 ms generated high torques comparable with the 
torque generated during functional electrical stimulation (50-60 
Nm, -70% of the maximum torque generated at 100 Hz) (Kralj 
et al. 1988; Marsolais and Kobetic 1988; Phillips 1989). Fourth, the 
severity of osteoporosis in long bones of individuals with chronic 
paralysis indicated that a reduced frequency should be employed 
to minimize the risk of a fracture. Finally, reducing the frequency 
of activation and increasing the duration of the test increased the 
likelihood that the transformed contractile machinery would be 
stressed (Zijdewind et al. 1990). This also would serve to minimize

the neuromuscular transmission compromise, a property that may 
be more preferential to FF muscle fibers (Enoka et al. 1989; Pagala 
et al. 1984). Five minutes after the conclusion of the 4-min test, 
all subjects were assessed for 5 s with the same protocol. 
Qualitative histochemical analysis 
One chronic subject had a muscle biopsy taken from the right 
soleus muscle and analyzed qualitatively for myosin ATPase and 
NADH-TR enzyme density. Specifically, an incision was made -3 
cm medial to the achilles tendon midline and one-fourth of the 
way from the malleolus to the knee. A 5 mm-diam muscle biopsy 
needle was passed through the incision three times yielding three 
tissue plugs measuring 3 x 3 X 2 mm. With the use of a stereo- 
scopic microscope and cold fiber optic light, the samples were 
oriented transversely, mounted on cork with the use of tissue tek, 
and immersed in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen at 
- 16OOC. 
Tissue samples were incubated in ATP and calcium at a pH of 
9.4, 4.6, and 4.2. In addition, samples were processed for the 
NADH-TR enzyme. The specific protocol used for staining has 
been previously reported (Dubowitz 1985). Qualitative counts of 
the specific numbers of fiber types present in a field were deter- 
mined and presented as the percent of a given fiber type. 
Torque and M-wave analvsis J 
Torque was calculated as the product of the external moment 
arm and the perpendicular force measured from the transducer. 
The plantarflexion torque was digitized at a rate of 100 Hz for 5 
s every 30 s during the 4-min test and a mean calculated. Figure 
1 shows the unfused tetanus and the associated M waves for one 
contraction of the 4-min protocol. The maximum measured torque 
was determined by using a least-squared quadratic fit algorithm. 
This best-f-it quadratic equation standardized the selection of the 
maximum element of the digitized torque array. A torque index 
was calculated by taking the quotient of the mean measured maxi- 
mum torque (5 s at 2 and 4 min, respectively) and the initial 
measured mean peak torque (5 s ) . 
The torque relaxation properties during the fatigue protocol were 
characterized by both time and rate measures. The half-relaxation 
time ( ‘/,RT) was the time it took for the maximum measured torque 
to drop to one-half of its value. Using the least-squared quadratic fit 
algorithm to detect the measured peak torque provided a consistent 
method to determine the midpoint of the peak torque curve. The 
maximal rate of relaxation (MRR) was determined by differentiat- 
ing the torque output with respect to time during the relaxation 
phase of the unfused tetanus. Custom software was developed to 
take a two-point differential for each set of digital values divided 
by the constant change in time. The MRR was normalized to the 
mean measured torque for that contraction and referred to as the 
nMRR. As with the torque, 5 s of data were sampled every 30 s 
during the 4-min protocol and means calculated. The ‘/,RT index 
and nMRR index were calculated as the mean (‘/,RT, nMRR) at 
2 and 4 min, respectively, divided by the initial mean value ( ‘&RT, 
nMRR). 
The initial M wave of five consecutive trains was analyzed every 
30 s during the fatigue protocol. Each M wave was digitized at a rate of 5 kHz, and the peak of the initial positive deflection was 
determined. Figure 1 shows the stimulus artifact followed by each 
M wave and the associated unfused tetanus. An M-wave index was 
determined by dividing each 5-s mean every 30 s by the initial 
5-s mean value. 
Repeated measures on five subjects demonstrated good repro- 
ducibility of all dependent measures with Pearson correlation coef- 
ficients ranging from 0.95 for torque to 0.69 for M-wave amplitude 
( Shields 1992b). 
RESULTS 
Torque and muscle relaxation properties 
Figure 2 (top) shows the percent of initial torque plotted 
every 30 s during the fatigue protocol for the chronic and 
acute paralyzed subject groups. The rapid loss of torque 
during the 1st 2 min of the stimulation protocol was followed 
by 2 min of minimal torque changes in the chronically para- 
lyzed group. Conversely, the acutely paralyzed group shows 
a more gradual linear decline in torque throughout the stimu- 
lation protocol. The mean torque index at 125 and 245 s of 
the fatigue test was 88 and 77%, respectively, for the acutely 
paralyzed group as compared with 27 and 22% at similar 
time periods for the chronically paralyzed group. 
Figure 2 (bottom) shows the percent of initial nMRR 
plotted every 30 s of the fatigue protocol in the chronically 
and acutely paralyzed groups. The chronic group shows a 
steep reduction in the nMRR during the 1st 2 min of the 
test followed by minimal changes in the final 2 min. Con- 
versely, the acute group shows minimal changes in the rate 
of relaxation during the test. The mean nMRR index at 125 
and 245 s of the fatigue protocol was 90 and 93% for the 
acute group in contrast to 38 and 41% for the same time 
periods in the chronic group. Figure 3 shows the percent of 
initial 1/2RT plotted every 30 s of the fatigue protocol in both 
groups. Again, note the prolongation in muscle relaxation 
time index within the 1st 2 min of the test in the chronic 
group as compared with the minimal change in the acute 
group. The mean $RT index at 125 and 245 s was 114 and 
107% for the acute group in contrast to the 272 and 228% 
found at similar time periods in the chronically paralyzed 
group. Figure 4 shows a representative example of the torque 
data overlaid every 30 s during 3 min of the fatigue protocol 
for a chronic (top) and acute (bottom) subject. The minimal 
fatigue and minimal change in relaxation properties during 
the fatigue protocol in the acute subject is evident. 
Descriptive analysis of each subjects absolute torque, 
nMRR, and ‘/*RT values initially and at 2 min of the fatigue 
protocol can be seen in Table 2. Statistical analyses [repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)] of the chronic 
group revealed that the torque, nMRR, and ‘/2RT was sig- 
nificantly changed from the initial torque at all time periods 
after 65 s. There was no difference between the values from

125 to 245 s of the fatigue test. In contrast, the acutely 
paralyzed group showed that the torque was significantly 
reduced from the initial only at 245 s of the fatigue protocol, 
and nMRR and ‘/*RT were not statistically changed during 
the fatigue protocol. The torque, ‘/,RT, and nMRR for the 
chronic group did not recover equally 5 min after the fatigue 
protocol (Table 2). 
Torque-relaxation properties relationship 
Figure 5 shows the relationship between the percent of 
initial torque and the percent of initial nMRR for each sub- 
ject during the fatigue protocol in the chronically paralyzed 
group. The entire data set was fit by the linear regression 
equation Y = 1.2174X - 0.1707 with an R* value of 0.85. 
This regression model indicates that 85% of the variability 
in the torque index could be explained by the nMRR index. 
Simple linear regression analysis for each subject revealed 
correlation coefficients that ranged from 0.88 to 0.97 sup-

cally paralyzed subject. The overall data were described by 
the linear regression equation consisting of Y = -0.3855X + 
1.276 with an R* value of 0.80. Linear regression analysis 
for each subject revealed Pearson correlation coefficients 
that ranged from 0.88 to 0.96. The close association between 
the changes in torque and relaxation properties of chronically 
paralyzed muscle suggests that the mechanisms that contrib- 
ute to the reduced torque covary with the mechanisms that 
contribute to prolonged relaxation properties during fatigue. 
A multiple regression model using both ‘/2RT and nMRR 
as independent variables did not significantly increase the 
predictability of torque (R* = 0.86). Similar relationships 
derived for the acutely paralyzed group revealed correlations 
ranging from 0.45 to 0.52 for nMRR and ‘/,RT, respectively. 
This lower relationship can be explained by the reduced 
power and a reduced range of values attributed to minimal 
changes in fatigability and relaxation properties during the 
fatigue protocol for the acute group. 
M-wave changes during fatigue 
Figure 7 shows the percent of initial M-wave amplitude 
plotted every 30 s during the 4-min fatigue protocol for the 
chronic and acute paralyzed subject groups. The chronically 
paralyzed subject group shows a minimal reduction during the 
1st min of the fatigue protocol followed by a greater reduction 
of the M-wave index during the final 3 min of the protocol. 
The acutely paralyzed subject group shows a minimal increase 
in M-wave amplitude during the initial stages of the fatigue 
protocol. The mean M-wave amplitude index at 125 and 245 
s of the fatigue test was 103 and 94% for the acute group, 
respectively. This is in contrast to the 88 and 73% found at 
similar time periods in the chronically paralyzed group.

by 185 s of the fatigue protocol occurred after the most 
significant reduction in torque. This suggests that neuromus-

the chronic group. 
Statistical analysis (repeated measures ANOVA) revealed 
that the M-wave amplitude was significantly reduced in the 
chronically paralyzed group at 185 and 245 s as compared 
with the initial amplitude. Conversely, there was no signifi-

sections were analyzed at a 4.2 preincubation (Fig. 11 B), 
all but a few cells showed a reversal of the more alkaline 
(9.4) section. This suggests that few type I fibers were pres- 
ent. Similar sections analyzed at a 4.6 pH (Fig. 11 C) showed 
a predominance of darkly stained cells, suggesting the pres- 
ence of type IIB fibers. Under these conditions, type IIB 
fibers stain darker than type IIA’s. In addition, the density 
of the NADH-TR oxidative enzyme appeared uniform (Fig. 
11 D) in all cells. Collectively, the limited sample supports 
that qualitatively a large percentage of the chronically para- 
lyzed soleus muscle is type IIB, which corroborates the work 
reported by Grimby and colleagues ( 1976). 
DISCUSSION 
Motor-unit (Burke et al. 1971; Dubose et al. 1987; Gardi- 
ner and Olha 1987; Gordon et al. 1990; Goslow et al. 1977; 
Sandercock et al. 1985) and normal whole muscle studies 
(Enoka et al. 1989; Kernel1 et al. 1987; Peter et al. 1972) 
suggest that muscle fatigability is associated with fiber type. 
A fatigue index <0.25 during a Burke fatigue protocol is 
consistent with FF motor units that, in general, stain high 
for myosin ATPase, stain low for oxidative enzymes, and 
have faster twitch contraction times (Burke et al. 197 1, 
1973 ) . However, the relationship among fatigue properties, 
fiber type, and contraction speeds appears less consistent in 
transformed muscle because of spinalization (Baldwin et al. 
1984; Cope et al. 1986)) immobilization (Bagust 1979; Cor- 
ley et al. 1984; Maier et al. 1976; Witzmann et al. 1983), and 
cross-reinnervation (Buller et al. 1960; Chan et al. 1982). 
It has been reported that slow postural muscles of many 
species have an innate resistance to transform after spinal 
cord lesions and that the soleus muscle remains relatively 
nonfatigable, even after 1 yr of paralysis (for review see 
Gordon and Pattullo 1993). This study evaluated the soleus 
muscle of chronically and acutely paralyzed humans to deter-

Six of the 10 chronic subjects tested in this study had a 
fatigue index <0.25, 2 were at 0.30 and 0.31, and 2 were 
at 0.48 and 0.50, respectively. On the basis of motor-unit 
classification schemes, all fatigue indexes in this study sug- 
gest that the chronically paralyzed soleus muscle was not 
functioning as a predominantly type I oxidative muscle. This 
also is supported by the histochemical studies completed by 
Grimby and colleagues ( 1976) and corroborated in our lim- 
ited histochemical analvsis.

The increased fat&ability was evident even though the 
Burke-like Fatigue protocol used in this study was modified 
from a 40-Hz to a 20-Hz frequency. Consequently, the fa- 
tigue index at 2 min in the chronically paralyzed soleus 
muscle appears to be conservative when compared with a 
test performed at 40 Hz (unpublished observations). For 
example, the contractile slowing accompanying the fatigue 
found in this study would better match a stimulation train 
with a lower frequency (20 Hz) than with a train at a higher 
frequency (40 Hz) ( Bigland-Ritchie et al. 1983). This would 
tend to attenuate the relative change in torque from initial to 
2 and 4 min of the fatigue protocol. However, all chronically 
paralyzed subjects still showed significant fatigue with this 
protocol by 2 min. Conversely, support that the fatigue test 
may have been related to fiber type is demonstrated by the 
relative lack of fatigue in the soleus muscle of the acutely 
paralyzed individuals receiving the same 20-Hz protocol 
(mean fatigue index, 0.88). 
It is tempting to assume the acutely paralyzed soleus mus- 
cle represents a normal soleus muscle because of the relative 
lack of fatigability. However, the acute subjects had nearly 
complete inactivation of their musculature for 4-6 wk after 
spinal transection. The short-term reduced activity did not 
induce changes in the fatigability of the soleus muscle. This 
finding is consistent with other short-term reduced activity 
studies (Bagust 1979; Maier et al. 1976; Munson et al. 1986; 
Witzmann et al. 1983). 
The measured torques generated in the chronically para- 
lyzed soleus muscle are similar to the volitional plan- 
tarflexion torques reported for nonparalyzed individuals 
(Sale et al. 1982). The maximum volitional plantarflexion 
torque with the knee and ankle maintained at 90” was 115 
N l m for 10 male subjects (Sale et al. 1982). The range of 
initial torque values in the chronically paralyzed group was 
5 1.9-84.0 N l m for the male subjects. Given that the 20-Hz 
stimulation frequency generated -6O-70% of the maximal 
torque capability (Sale et al. 1982)) the mean torque value 
of 67.7 N l m found for the chronic subjects represents -70% 
of the maximum plantarflexion torque reported for normal 
males with the knee flexed to 90” (Sale et al. 1982). Despite 
obvious atrophy in all subjects (chronics and acutes), the 
chronic group generated a torque that was quite comparable 
with reports for normal able-bodied subjects (Sale et al. 
1982). Whether transformed muscle has an altered specific 
tension or altered muscle connective tissue leading to an 
improved transmission of force is unknown and was not 
determined in this study. Interestingly, Lieber and colleagues 
reported that the cross-sectional area of the rat soleus muscle 
had decreased by 50% 1 yr after spinal transection, but the 
soleus muscle continued to generate the same absolute ten- 
sion (Lieber et al. 1986). 
Many studies on reduced muscle activity have reported 
unchanged fatigability despite evidence for muscle fiber con- 
version to type II (Bagust 1979; Cope et al. 1986; Corley 
et al. 1984; Maier et al. 1976; Witzmann et al. 1983). This 
may, in part, be explained by the short time of the reduced 
activity leading to an incomplete transformation of all en- 
zyme systems. However, the most compelling reports in- 
volved the long-term follow-up of spinalized cats that were 
found to have unchanged soleus muscle fatigability despite 
evidence for muscle fiber transformations (Baldwin et al. 1989; Cope et al. 1986; Mayer et al. 1984; Roy et al. 199 1) . 
In contrast to these studies, the human chronically paralyzed 
soleus muscle, evaluated in this study, was found to be 
highly fatigable, consistent with the histochemical analysis 
reported by Grimby and colleagues ( 1976), and confirmed 
by our single soleus muscle sample. 
The discrepancy between our findings on the human para- 
lyzed soleus muscle and the long-term paralyzed cat soleus 
muscle may be attributed to many factors. First, the I-yr 
time period of paralysis in the cat may not translate into an 
equivalent time period in humans, with respect to muscle 
plasticity, suggesting that the human soleus muscle is more 
mutable. Second, the pattern of muscle activation induced 
by spinal reflexes may be quite different in animal models 
thus serving to maintain the oxidative capacity of the muscle 
(Jiang et al. 1990). Third, the muscle fiber type of the human 
soleus muscle may be predominantly comprised of type I 
fibers (Gollnick et al. 1974; Johnson et al. 1973)) but also 
have considerable numbers of type IIA fibers. After spinal 
transection, the IIA fibers may go on to transform to IIB. 
Gollnick et al. ( 1974) reported a range of 64- 100% of type 
I fibers in the human soleus, suggesting that the fiber type 
distribution may not be as consistent across humans as that 
found in the cat. These fiber type differences across species 
may partly explain the increased fatigue found in the human 
paralyzed soleus muscle. 
No follow-up studies on spinalized cats have been com- 
pleted beyond 1 yr; consequently, it is not known whether 
longer durations of the paralyzed condition would ulti- 
mately induce muscle adaptations leading to increased fat- 
igability. Whether the soleus muscle of cats are capable 
of a complete transformation to type IIB fatigable fibers 
remains unresolved. However, in a similar period of re- 
duced activity, this study showed that the human para- 
lyzed soleus muscle fatigues as if a complete transforma- 
tion to type II fatigable fibers has occurred. Interestingly, 
the presence of type IIB myosin heavy chains in paralyzed 
cat soleus muscle has been recently suggested (Talmadge 
et al. 1993).

Paralyzed muscle contractile relaxation properties during 
fatigue 
The relaxation properties of the chronically paralyzed so- 
leus muscle was very consistent with changes previously 
reported for FF motor units (Dubose et al. 1987; Gordon et 
al. 1990) and predominantly type II whole muscle studies 
(Enoka et al. 1989) during repetitive activation. Further- 
more, the minimal change in relaxation properties of the 
acutely paralyzed soleus muscle was consistent with proper- 
ties of slow motor units (Gordon et al. 1990) and predomi- 
nantly type I whole muscle studies (Rankin et al. 1988). 
Gordon and colleagues ( 1990) evaluated the relaxation 
properties from an unfused tetanus during a standard fatigue 
protocol in a sample of motor units from the cat tibialis 
posterior muscle. Interestingly, the mean relaxation time in- 
dexes for fast intermediate and slow motor units were 260 
and lOO%, respectively. In comparison, the chronically para- 
lyzed soleus muscle ‘/,RT index was 268%, whereas the 
acutely paralyzed soleus muscle was 114%. The similarity 
between the contractile relaxation properties during a stan- 
dard fatigue test in fast and slow motor units of the cat and 
the human paralyzed soleus muscle (acute and chronic) in 
this study was quite interesting. This investigation suggests 
that chronically and acutely paralyzed whole muscle may 
provide a method to study fiber type specific properties in 
a whole human skeletal muscle. 
The correlation between torque and relaxation property 
changes in chronically paralyzed muscle during fatigue was 
0.92. This high association lends support to the notion that 
the mechanisms leading to reduced torque covary with the 
mechanisms leading to prolonged muscle relaxation during 
a standard fatigue protocol. The slowing of muscle relax- 
ation during fatigue has been attributed to calcium uptake 
(Allen et al. 1989; Jones 198 1) and a change in the rate 
of cross-bridge cycling (Allen et al. 1989; Dawson et al. 
1980; Edman and Lou 1990; Edwards et al. 1975 ) . Tension

reduction during fatigue has been attributed to insufficient 
excitation-contraction coupling (calcium) and decreased 
force production of individual cross bridges (Edman and 
Lou 1990). Type II fibers are believed to be predisposed 
to calcium kinetic compromise during repetitive activation 
(Ruegg 1987). 
Despite the close association between torque and relax- 
ation properties in chronically paralyzed muscle during fa- 
tigue, the dissociation found during recovery suggests differ- 
ent mechanisms. Hultman and Sjoholm ( 1983) found a close 
association between force and relaxation properties during 
fatigue of the human quadriceps femoris muscle (50% type 
II), but, after 2 min of recovery, the force returned to 20% 
of its initial value, whereas the relaxation time returned to 
80% of its initial value. The dissociation between torque and 
relaxation properties found in this study is consistent with 
Hultman and Sjoholm’s ( 1983) report, although they used 
a continuous electrical stimulation at 20 Hz. 
The rapid change in relaxation properties of human chron- 
ically paralyzed muscle during and shortly after fatigue has 
very important clinical implications. These changing con- 
tractile properties suggest that the activation frequency 
should be modulated to match these contractile properties 
to minimize inefficient activation of skeletal muscle during 
functional electrical stimulation (Bigland-Ritchie et al. 1983; 
Bigland-Ritchie and Woods 1984). The relative lack of con- 
tractile prolongation reported for slow motor units (Dubose 
et al. 1987; Gordon et al. 1990)) and also found for the 
acutely paralyzed soleus muscle in this study, suggests that 
minimal amounts of stimulus modulation is required in non- 
fatigable muscle fibers (Gordon et al. 1990). Conversely, 
extensive modulation of the activation frequency may be 
essential to optimally match the changing contractile proper- 
ties in human paralyzed muscle. This concept has far-reach- 
ing implications to the future development of functional acti- 
vation systems for highly fatigable muscle of chronically 
paralyzed individuals.

Fig. 9, all chronically paralyzed subjects showed the greatest 
decline in torquEl during this Sam62 time period. Conse- 
quently, although the M-wave amplitude response became 
more variable across subjects after 90 s of the fatigue proto- 
col. it is apparent that the M waves responded consistently 
during the greatest declines in torque. This type of dissocia- 
tion between torque and M-wave amplitude has been sug- 
gested to indicate that fatigue is not primarily attributed to 
neuromuscular transmission failure: (Bigland-Ritchie et al. 
1983: Enoka et al. 1989; Kmjevic and Miledi 195X; Pagala 
et al. 1984). 
The overall correlation between M-wave amplitude and 
torque was 0.55 for the chronically paralyzed group but 
only 0.05 for the acutely paralyzed group. This suggests a 
preferential change in M-wave amplitude between the non- 
e (acute ) and fatigable soleus muscle (chronic) in 
paralyzed humanh. Thic may reflect differential changes in 
hareolemmal membrane properties x the result of chronic 
paralysis. However, as previously noted, these M-wave 
changes did not appear to be the primary cause of the early 
decrements in torque. 
Similar preferential M-wave amplitude responses during 
repetitive activation of predominantly fast and slow skeletal 
whole muscle has been reported (Enoka et al. 1989; Pagala 
ijdewind et al. 1990). Pagala et al. ( 1984), 
using an m vi&o fluid electrode and JO-Hz modified Burke 
fatigue protocol ( I984 ) ‘I found that the predominantly type 
III3 rat extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscle showed a 
close association between force and M-wave amplitude (r = 
(1.99). Conversely, the soleus muscle was found to be least 
correlated (0.74). In comparison, Enoka et al. ( 1989) found 
that 50--700/c nf the variability in force of the rat edl could 
explained by M-wave changes, whereas only 15-36% of 
variability in force of the rat soleus muscle could be 
explained by M-wave changes. Similar differential relations 
between force and motor-unit action potentials (MUAP) 
have been reported for fast and slow motor units (Gardiner 
ahd Olha 1987; Sanderctxk et al. 1985) + Gardiner and Olha 
( I987 ) found a mean percentage MUAP amplitude reduction 
of 74% far FF motor units, 28% for fast intermediate (F1) 
motor units. and only 4% for the slow (S) units during a Burke protocol, Sandercock et al. ( 1985) reported a better 
relationship between force and M wave for FF motor units 
than for S motor units and that the relationship is progres- 
sively improved as the stimulation frequency increased from 
40 to 80 Hz (r = 0.50-0.81 ). These higher frequencies 
would tend to preferentially challenge the neuromuscular 
transmission capabilities of the units, 
The dissociation between M-wave amplitude and torque 
as seen in the early phase of the fatigue protocol and after 
5 min of recovery appears to support that electrical activation 
failure, either presynaptically at branch points, or at the neu- 
romuscular junction, is not the mechanism contributing to 
the reduced torque in the chronically paralyzed soieus mus- 
adenosine triphosphatxe enzyme with a preincubation at pH 9.4 (A ), pH

integrity of the neuromuscular transmission system using a 
40-Hz frequency is not known. 
Further study, with more than three subjects, is necessary 
to more convincingly verify that the M-wave amplitude re-

and the acutely paralyzed group. However, there was a trend 
suggesting less decline in M-wave amplitude during the fa-

sion was a critical factor in determining fatigue then greater 
differences between the M-wave amplitude of the chronic 
and acute soleus muscle would have been more apparent. 
In summary, this study showed that chronically paralyzed 
muscle is highly fatigable, consistent with histochemical pre- 
dominance of type II fatigable fibers. Conversely, muscle 
paralyzed for 4-6 wk shows minimal changes in fatigue 
properties, consistent with a histochemical predominance of 
type I fibers. Temporal evidence supports that significant 
fatigue is present after 1 yr of paralysis in the human soleus 
muscle. This finding is contrary to the chronically paralyzed 
cat soleus muscle studies of a similar duration. Associated 
changes in relaxation properties are consistent with type IIB 
muscle in the chronic group and type I muscle in the acute 
group. Neuromuscular transmission does not appear to con- 
tribute to increased fatigue in chronically paralyzed muscle 
activated repetitively with a 20-Hz frequency. Finally, dur- 
ing recovery, M-wave and muscle relaxation properties are 
generally recovered by 5 min despite continued attenuation 
of torque. BURKE, R. E., LEVINE, D. N., TSAIRIS, P., AND ZAJAC, F. E. Physiologic
