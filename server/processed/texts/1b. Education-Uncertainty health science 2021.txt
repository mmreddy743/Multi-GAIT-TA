1|PERSPECTIVE
Healthcare is increasingly complex; with increased complexity comes
increased uncertainty. Historically , however, most medical practice and
medical education occur in the context of certainty. The coronavirus dis-
ease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has illuminated the gap in training stu-
dents in the health professions to function in environments of bothcertainty and uncertainty. Medical students are typically presented with
facts, associations, and algorithms, and are later assessed through methods
that either has a single correct answ er or a series of acceptable answers
with a single meaning (eg, multiple-choice examinations and objective struc-
tured clinical examinations).
1The transition from the classroom to the clini-
cal learning environment poses medical students with significant struggles.
These may include struggles with diagnosis, management, communication,patient care, and care coordination. To date, formal training and assessment
to enhance comfort with an d management of uncertain ty in clinical practice
are lacking in many training programs.
1A curriculum in Health Systems Sci-
ence (HSS) can specifically acknowledge and address the uncertainty intrin-
sic to modern medical care and, in doing so, better prepare students for the
transition to the clinical environment, the intrinsic complexity of thehealthcare system, and the uncertainty of professional clinical practice.
1.1 |Uncertainty
Uncertainty in clinical medicine affects all parts of clinical practice,
from diagnosis to treatment decisions.2Lee et al define uncertainty as“the dynamic, subjective perception of not knowing what to think,
feel, or do. ”3To this effect, three core dimensions of uncertainty in
clinical practice are described: the sources of uncertainty, the subjec-tive nature of uncertainty, and responses to uncertainty.
3The most
common dimension in defining uncertainty is its source, which may
stem from knowledge, relationships, and complex systems.3The cog-
nitive impact these sources of uncertainty have in practitioners, inturn, influences their respective responses and actions.
3
Students ill-equipped to address uncertainty in the clinical envi-
ronment can undergo cognitive dissonance,4diminished self-efficacy,
and erosion of empathy.5Uncertainty can lead to maladaptive perfec-
tionism and burnout.6,7The traditional emphasis on linear thinking in
medical school can thwart creative problem-solving approaches, alter-native perspectives, and the ability to calibrate for uncertainty
5—all of
which are tools needed to thrive in today's clinical learning and work-
ing environment. Personal perspectives on uncertainty have been
found to impact patient communication,7decision-making ability,8
resource utilization,7and attitudes toward groups of patients.9Physi-
cians' anxiety toward clinical uncertainty is associated with increased
cost of care, as well as a reluctance to fully disclose information topatients.
7Studies have even suggested that tolerance of uncertainty
impacts students' willingness to work with underserved communities,
and influences how providers address pain management during timesof diagnostic ambiguity.
6,9,10
Intentional training in uncertainty is important not only because
of the increasing complexity of healthcare and its associated systemsbut also because of the way access to information has changed per-sonal relationships with uncertainty. In a simple model of uncertainty,

or“unknown ”to self, and “known ”or“unknown ”to others.11Individ-
uals experience their own uncertainty when something is unknown tothem and either known or unknown to others. In a world of constant
access to information at our fingertips, individuals have less exposure
to situations where information is unknown or unknowable to themand known to others —take, for example, the use of navigation applica-
tions (apps) utilizing global positioning system (GPS) services on
smartphone devices. This decrease in experience managing day-to-day uncertainty may decrease skill in managing the less common type
of uncertainty where information, or truth, is unknown to self, as well
as to others.
1.2 |The clinical environment
The clinical learning and working environment are intrinsically uncer-
tain, and the transition into this workplace is a point where students
frequently struggle. First and foremost, the work is complex.Students are introduced to tools they have never encountered before,
such as the electronic health record (EHR), which differs from institu-
tion to institution or may change several times at a single institution.New members are continuously added to teams. Team roles are in
constant evolution, now including community health workers, acute
care managers, and patient navigators. Teams are constantly in flux,with new members creating dynamic expectations and interactions.The practice milieu and overarching system of healthcare are also sub-
ject to change, as seen by the impact the Affordable Care Act has had
on health delivery in the United States.
12
The addition of learners (ie, students, residents, fellows, and allied
health professionals) into the working environment only adds to this
complexity. Multiple outcomes of interest —clinical and educational —
compete for priority. While frameworks characterizing the clinical
learning environment exist to describe its interrelated personal, social,
organizational, physical, and virtual workplace components, each ofwhich directly links to the broader health system,
13,14the clinical envi-
ronment is challenged by role clarity, the changing nature of teams,
adequacy of learner supervision, and learner mistrust. It is often diffi-
cult for clinical teams immersed in the clinical learning environment(CLE) to make informed decisions during instances of heightened
complexity, when the relationship between cause and effect is
blurred, and when there are minimal causal loops to guide teamsthrough the uncertainty. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has greatly
magnified the complexity intrinsic to the CLE, highlighting the need
for formal training surrounding times of uncertainty.
1.3 |The COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how critical it is for physi-
cians to function at a high level during times of uncertainty. Through-
out the early stages of the pandemic, and as the demand for healthservices increased exponentially across health systems, clinical pro-
viders were forced to adapt and re-adapt to rapidly evolvingguidelines and settings.
15Correct answers were not immediately
available. Shortages of healthcare professionals, adequate access topersonal protective equipment (PPE), and the urgent need for training
clinical teams on infection control and prevention exemplified
instances in which volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguitychallenged CLEs and health systems together.
16There was simply no
time for clinical teams to step back and gain an understanding of the
“big picture, ”an overarching goal for systems thinking.17The pace of
change and progress outstripped the ability to take a purposeful and
analytic approach. Providers, leaders, and learners were forced to act
and react to a status quo that evolved and morphed daily. There wasno stable state. Instead, individuals with the necessary aptitude towork in conditions of high uncertainty and chaos had to create local
networks to learn, communicate, stabilize, and continuously adapt.
While most junior learners were removed from the clinical envi-
ronment in the early days of the pandemic for safety and PPE preser-
vation, this experience exemplified the need for skills in managing
workplace disruption and uncertainty. Now, as junior learners re-enterthe CLE, it is clear that the pandemic accentuated several of the chal-
lenges that typically accompany the transition into this type of work-
ing environment. Several of these challenges include:
How do students contribute to the care of patients they are not
allowed to assess in person?
How do learners manage a disease process they have never been
formally taught to manage, especially in the face of rapidly changingevidence and guidelines, and variable expertise among supervising
faculty?
How does one manage a clinical situation when personal risk for
infection is unclear?
How should students manage themselves when:
1. their respective supervisor does not know an answer?
2. their role is suddenly unclear?
3. duration of training changes dramatically?
1.4 |Making sense amidst uncertainty and
complexity
It is essential that curricula in health professions education help stu-
dents make sense of —and take action amidst —the heightened uncer-
tainty they will encounter in their practice. In clinical situations that
change dynamically and do not obey causal laws, where teams cannot
predict the results of their actions, much like the early stages of thepandemic, teams will require a framework to guide their ability to
learn together within the context of uncertainty and collaboratively
develop their own solutions as they probe the system, make sense ofit, and learn from it before they respond. To an extent, this is a prac-tice that is already routinely observed in quality improvement patient
safety initiatives that leverage iterative PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act)
cycles of improvement. Such a framework should consider the individ-uals and teams within specific clinical contexts, and provide them with
the respective scaffolding to make sense of their experiences as they2o f5 PAPANAGNOU ET AL. &C?JRFѥ1AGCLACѥ0CNMPRQ
work through uncertainty. The Cynefin framework, first introduced by
David Snowden, represents such a framework for categorizing issuesand strategies.
18
The Cynefin framework is a conceptual framework that can aid in
decision-making during uncertain times and draws upon research fromcomplexity science. The framework offers specific decision-making
contexts (or domains) in which individuals and/or teams of individuals
can make sense of their experiences. Applying this framework to theuncertainty in the CLE, issues facing clinical teams are sorted into five
unique contexts defined by the nature of the relationship between
cause and effect.
18Four of these domains (ie, simple, complicated,
complex, and chaotic) require clinicians and teams to diagnose situa-tions and act in ways that are contextually appropriate (Figure 1).
18
The two domains on the right represent the “ordered ”domains of
‘simple ’and ‘complicated ’—with clear links between cause and effect
and where correct answers can be determined based on data and
facts. The two domains on the left represent the “unordered ”domains
of“complex ”and “chaos ”—with no apparent cause and effect rela-
tionship, where emerging patterns inform future actions.18A fifth
domain, “disorder ”, describes instances in which it is unclear, which of
the four contexts is predominant. For clinical teams working in a com-plex system, such as the CLE during the time of COVID-19, team
members may not be aware of what they do not know. Teams must
iteratively interact and experiment with the system to determine gen-eral patterns before a definitive answer, or even causality, becomesapparent.
There has been some integration of complexity science into
health professions education. For example, Noyer et al investigatedthe influence of perceived task complexity on the diagnostic reason-
ing of osteopathy students and found that when prompted to per-
ceive a case as complex, student reliance on analytical approachesincreased at the expense of non-analytical reasoning.
19The authors
posit that to reduce cognitive load and avoid associated diagnosticerror, however, strategies should be adopted that contextualize learn-
ing19; the Cynefin framework may represent such a strategy.
Aside from the integration of complexity science into health pro-
fessions education, opportunities for curricular development that pre-
pare students for this uncertainty exist. Incorporation of the liberalarts, humanities programs, and patient-centered narratives into formal
curriculum has been shown to improve students' abilities to think lat-
erally.
20,21Discussing the “philosophy of medicine ”within clinical
coursework can provide trainees with the familiarity to appraise and
describe the uncertainty they are experiencing.2The deliberate prac-
tice of communicating diagnostic uncertainty to patients, when a diag-nosis to explain patients' symptoms is unknown, can prepare traineesfor challenging, emotionally charged conversations.
22,23These conver-
sations can be embedded into objective structured clinical encounters
(OSCEs) that are focused on communication training.24Similarly, cour-
sework in HSS is uniquely poised to introduce students to this
uncertainty.
1.5 |A curriculum in uncertainty: An opportunity
for HSS
HSS is uniquely positioned to introduce medical students to the
uncertainty that exists in clinical practice and as early as Day 1 oftheir training. HSS can borrow elements of the Cynefin frameworkand equip learners with skills in pr oblem-solving, such as being able
to facilitate open, interactive communication that can help share
ideas, such as critical incident debriefings, or generate and askhigher-order, divergent questions (eg, “what if we ”or“how might
we”questions) during times of uncertainty. Medical schools have
increasingly integrated HSS into their respective formal curricula to
better prepare trainees to thrive in today's healthcare system.
Described as the third educational pillar that complements the basic
and clinical sciences, HSS provides a framework of competenciesrelated to value-based care, population health, interprofessional col-laboration, health system improvement, and systems thinking.
25
Reconciling the uncertainty that is part of clinical practice is not itsown class or field of study; in actuality, it is a theme integratedacross these HSS competencies.
A curriculum in HSS can provide students with tools to prepare
them for the uncertainty and complexity of the clinical practice envi-ronment. Students will be immersed in situations where they will have
to apply clinical reasoning skills and act with confidence in ambiguous
situations.
26Students should have the opportunity to openly discuss,
reconstruct, and redefine their understanding of clinical problems
employing the tools and resources that will be immediately available
to them.20An understanding of HSS can equip students with the abil-
ity to appraise and/or diagnose the uncertainty they may encounter inclinical practice, which may be helpful in identifying next steps and
strategies (ie, is a specific course of action in a specific clinical context
a“knowable ”or“unknowable ”uncertainty).
27Knowledge gaps, for
example, could be addressed through referencing the literature or
consulting with team members, while other forms of uncertainty (eg,
 FIGURE 1 The Cynefin frameworkPAPANAGNOU ET AL. 3o f5 &C?JRFѥ1AGCLACѥ0CNMPRQ
personal or conceptual) would require a more individualized
approach.27
A curriculum in HSS exposes students to cognitive science and
raises their awareness of patterns that allow them to think and act
quickly during times of uncertainty.27Conversations would focus on
providers' craving for a sense of certainty, which often leads to pre-
mature closure and misdiagnosis.27Similarly, and as a direct lesson
of the pandemic, students require an understanding of best prac-tices in teamwork, communication, and facilitating debriefing con-
versations with team members. Training in uncertainty could also
improve patient-centered care. For example, at least one-third ofpatients are discharged from the emergency department without adiagnosis, and more than 40% of trainees encountered challenges
with discharging patients with diagnostic uncertainty, with >50% of
trainees reporting a strong desire for additional training in how tofacilitate these conversations.
22,23By discussing uncertainty with
patients, whether about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prog-
nosis, providers can navigate uncertainty through shared decision-making.
27
To address the web of interdependent and interrelated parts of
the clinical environment, HSS has leveraged systems thinking as anapproach to better understand how health systems work and how to
navigate the complex adaptive challenges they pose.
17Given the
complex nature of health systems, however, a curriculum in HSS cansupplement a systems-thinking approach with frameworks groundedin complexity science (eg, the Cynefin framework) for trainees to rely
on as they make sense of —and take action amidst —the heightened
uncertainty they will encounter in their clinical practice.
For simple and complex contexts, where patterns repeat, where
events are consistent, and where cause-and-effect relationships are
evident and/or discoverable, practitioners should be able to navigateclinical problems through fact-based management.
18For complex and
chaotic contexts, however, entirely different approaches to problem-
solving will be needed to emerge from the uncertainty presented inthe clinical environment. The early stages of the pandemic were com-plex: right answers to management were not readily available; instruc-
tive patterns were emergent; leadership was pattern-based; and
creative and innovative approaches were required. To be prepared forcomplex situations in the clinical environment, HSS can equip learners
with skills in problem-solving and sense-making, such as being able to
pose higher-order, divergent questions to their teams during times ofuncertainty, or leading conversations that can help generate ideas and
creative solutions. The foundational domains of HSS themselves (ie,
leadership, teaming, ethics, and change agency, management, andadvocacy) can also serve as tools to manage and navigate uncertainty
in clinical practice.
Conceptually, training in health professions education should
highlight the uncertainty that is intrinsic to clinical practice and openlyembrace it, rather than trying to eliminate it in curricula. Frameworks
borrowed from complexity science can serve as tools to help clinicians
better define uncertainty, better identify strategies to deal with thisuncertainty in the clinical environment, and avoid using reductionist
approaches to complex situations.
28Similarly, we have opportunitiesto leverage the humanities, as well as innovative problem-solving in
formal curricula to better prepare trainees for the complexity anduncertainty that lie ahead. Educators and curriculum designers must
also ensure that the educational innovation that was witnessed during
the pandemic continues to thrive, and does not revert back to thepre-COVID status quo.
15Reflecting on lessons learned from the pan-
demic, a mandate to longitudinally include HSS in formal curriculum is
required to better prepare medical school graduates to address thecomplexities and the uncertainty that lies ahead in their professional
careers.
