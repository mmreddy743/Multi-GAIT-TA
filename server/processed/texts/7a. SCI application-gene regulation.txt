Abstract
Paralysis after a spinal cord injury (SCI) induces physiological adaptations that
compromise the musculoskeletal and metabolic systems. Unlike non-SCI
individuals, people with spinal cord injury experience minimal muscle activity which
compromises optimal glucose utilization and metabolic control. Acute or chronicmuscle activity, induced through electrical stimulation, may regulate key genes that
enhance oxidative metabolism in paralyzed muscle. We investigated the short and
long term effects of electrically induced exercise on mRNA expression of human
paralyzed muscle. We developed an exercise dose that activated the muscle for
only 0.6% of the day. The short term effects were assessed 3 hours after a singledose of exercise, while the long term effects were assessed after training 5 days
per week for at least one year (adherence 81%). We found a single dose of
exercise regulated 117 biological pathways as compared to 35 pathways after one
year of training. A single dose of electrical stimulation increased the mRNA
expression of transcriptional, translational, and enzyme regulators of metabolismimportant to shift muscle toward an oxidative phenotype (PGC-1 a, NR4A3, IFRD1,
ABRA, PDK4). However, chronic training increased the mRNA expression of
specific metabolic pathway genes (BRP44, BRP44L, SDHB, ACADVL),
mitochondrial fission and fusion genes (MFF, MFN1, MFN2), and slow muscle fiber
genes (MYH6, MYH7, MYL3, MYL2). These findings support that a dose ofelectrical stimulation ( ,10 minutes/day) regulates metabolic gene signaling
pathways in human paralyzed muscle. Regulating these pathways early after SCI
may contribute to reducing diabetes in people with longstanding paralysis from SCI.

Introduction
Muscle paralysis after a spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a cascade of events that
disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of paralyzed muscle. Healthy skeletal muscle is
involved with over 70% of daily glucose utilization [ 1]. Paralyzed muscle rapidly
atrophies and transforms oxidative fibers into predominantly fast-twitch,
glycolytic fibers [ 2–8]. Skeletal muscle that becomes glycolytic is a precursor to
decreased insulin receptor sensitivity [ 9]. Individuals with SCI are at a higher risk
of developing metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart complications, and renal
failure [ 10–14]. We have demonstrated that regular training of paralyzed muscle
reduces muscle atrophy, preserves fatigue-resistance, and maintains the under-
lying skeletal system in people with SCI [ 6,15–17]. However, we are not aware of
the specific genes regulated by an acute bout of minimal muscle activity as
compared to a long duration minimal muscle activity program in humans with
paralysis.
Gene expression profiling is one method to survey the genome for mRNA
transcripts common to a specific phenotype [ 18]. For example, through gene set
enrichment methods, diabetes was linked to a decrease in the expression of
oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in skeletal muscle [ 18]. People with
paralysis experience limited muscle activity after the 10–30 minute bout of
exercise using electrical stimulation, which is unlike people without paralysis, who
are active between exercise bouts. We are interested in understanding if a single
dose of muscle activity (muscle activated for less than.6% of the day equal to
,10 minutes) versus a chronic dose of muscle activity (.6% of the day performed
regularly over 1 year) regulates distinct gene transcription and metabolism
pathways. No previous report, to our knowledge, has determined if acute andchronic muscle activity, induced electrically, regulates genes associated with
glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), fatty acid oxidation, oxidative
phosphorylation, and mitochondria dynamics (fission, fusion, and biogenesis) in
people with SCI.
Key muscle transcription factors and co-activators are known to be responsive
to metabolic and mechanical stress induced through muscle contractions in
healthy people [
19]. Previous studies have identified several of these stress
response genes including peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-
coactivator-alpha (PGC-1 a)[18,20–22]; nuclear orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1/
NR4A3) [ 23,24]; interferon-related developmental regulator-1 (IFRD1) [ 25]; and
actin-binding Rho-activating protein (ABRA/STARS) [ 21,26,27]. The induction
or repression of these major transcription factors would trigger a cascade of events
ultimately leading to the transformation of the underlying metabolic state of
paralyzed skeletal muscle. Accordingly, genes associated with glycolysis (PDK4,PDHA1, PDHB, and PDHX) [
28–33], fatty acid oxidation (ACADVL, ACADL,
ACAD8, ACAD9) [ 33–36], tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) (BRP44, BRP44L,
OGDH, SDHB) [ 33,37], oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFB1, NDUFA2, CYC1,
COQ10A) [ 33,38], and mitochondria dynamics including fission, fusion, and

biogenesis (MFF, OPA1, MFN1, and MFN2) [ 33,39,40] and their associated
pathways are the primary focus of this investigation.
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a single dose and a
chronic dose of electrical stimulation on human paralyzed muscle. We expect a
single dose of muscle activity will result in an increased expression of metabolic
transcription factors associated with the transformation of fibers from fast to slow.
In contrast, we expect the chronically trained muscle will show the long term
stable expression of genes associated with the maintenance of oxidative metabolic
pathways, despite the minimal daily activity performed (10 minutes/day). Overall,
these findings will support the hypothesis that a minimal dose of muscle activity,performed regularly, is an important and powerful metabolic regulator of skeletal
muscle health, even in people with paralysis, who cannot exercise throughout the
day.
Methods
Subjects
Five human subjects (30.40 ¡4.39 years of age) with complete paraplegia were
analyzed in this study. The protocol was approved by the University of Iowa
Human Subjects Review Board, and all subjects provided written informed
consent before participating. Three subjects received a single dose of electric
muscle stimulation unilaterally 3 hours before a bilateral soleus muscle biopsy;
whereas two subjects were muscle biopsied twice after training for .1 year
(technical reference). All subjects had complete paraplegia (ASIA-A) at or belowT4 and had been paralyzed for over 1.5 years. None of the subjects used electrical
muscle stimulation of the soleus prior to the start of this study. The training
subjects sustained over 81% compliance with the training protocol. The training
subjects discontinued training 5 days prior to the soleus muscle biopsy procedure
to capture the homeostatic effect of long term training and minimize the influence
an acute dose of activity has on gene regulation. All biopsies were normalized to
the same person’s limb that did not receive training. The control limb has
previously been shown to remain physiologically identical when the opposite limb
is being trained [
3,4,6,15,41,42]; however, it is conceivable that some gene
regulation may occur in the control limb from the training.
Acute Electrical Stimulation Protocol
The acutely stimulated subjects had a single session of unilateral muscle
stimulation of the soleus muscle. None of these individuals had received prior
electrical stimulation. Subjects sat in their wheelchair while the experimenter
positioned one leg into the testing apparatus in order to elicit an isometric
contraction of the soleus muscle [ 3,4,6,15,41,42]. The ankle and knee were
flexed to 90 ˚and the limb was secured to the apparatus with soft straps above the
knee to provide resistance for an isometric contraction. The 90 ˚knee angle

minimizes the contribution of the gastrocnemius muscle to plantar flexion torque,
creating a more reproducible measure of the performance of the soleus muscle[
3,4,6,41,42].
Electrical stimulation was delivered to the plantar flexor muscles using reusable
adhesive carbon electrodes. Stimulation was provided by a constant current
electrical stimulator with a 0 to 400 milliamp range at 400 volts (Digitimer ModelDS7A, Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England). Thestimulator was controlled by digital pulses from a data-acquisition board(Metrabyte DAS 16F, Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA) housed ina microcomputer under custom software control. Single pulses were given atincreasing intensity until maximal twitch torque was observed via an oscilloscope.Stimulation intensity was increased an additional 50% and remained at this levelfor the remainder of the experiment to insure supra maximal activation. Subjectsreceived 5 warm-up contractions (10 Hz, 7 pulses per contraction) to potentiatethe plantar flexor muscles and minimize the risk of muscle strain. After the warm-up contractions, the plantar flexor muscles were activated with 10 Hz stimulationtrains (7 pulses) every 2100 ms for 120 isometric contractions. After a 5 minuterest, subjects received a second bout of 120 contractions at the same intensity andfrequency. After the second bout, an experimenter used an indelible ink pen to
mark the trained leg with the time that stimulation ended in preparation for the
3 hr post-activation bilateral soleus biopsy. The biopsy sampled fibers that hadreceived the acute dose of electrical stimulation.
Chronic Electrical Stimulation Protocol
The right soleus muscle was trained for at least one year then discontinuedtraining 5 days prior to obtaining bilateral muscle biopsies. The training protocolconsisted of 4 bouts of 125 contractions (15 Hz; train duration 667 ms) per daywith a 5 minute rest period between each bout [
6,15]. The subjects trained one
limb while the opposite limb did not receive any electrical stimulation training.The subjects performed a total of 333.3 seconds of supra maximal muscleactivation per day, representing less than 0.6% of the day that the muscle wasactive.
MRI Acquisition and Analysis
Due to the known association between metabolic risk and the fat to muscle ratio,
we decided to illustrate the differences in phenotype between the trained and
untrained limbs by using an axial-plane spin-echo, T1-weighted magneticresonance (MR) image from the trained muscle and the untrained muscles of thecalf and thigh (1.5 T Siemens Avanto Scanner). A three-dimensional gradient-echo-based sequence was used for high-resolution imaging. The acquisitionparameters included repetition time (TR) of 15.0 ms and echo-time (TE) of6.7 ms with a 512 6256 matrix covering a field of view of 46 cm 618 cm and a
2.5-mm slice distance, creating a voxel volume of about 1.58 mm

only obtained from subject 2, as subject 1 had metal fragments retained within his
body from his initial injury [ 15]. The MR images were analyzed using a custom
MATLAB/C223(The Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA, USA v.2011) script, which utilized
image registration and segmentation algorithms implemented in the MATITK
toolkit [ 43]. Using the image histogram, the images were segmented into three
tissue types (adipose, muscle, and compact bone/background). After segmenta-
tion, the number of voxels corresponding to each tissue type was totaled and
multiplied by the voxel volume of 1.58 mm3, providing an estimate to the total
area for each tissue type within the limb. The trained and untrained limbs were
separated into two regional sites (the distal thigh and the proximal calf) each
consisting of 30 image slices. The proximal calf maximized the inclusion of thesoleus muscle, while the distal thigh was used as a control to illustrate the
specificity of training to the soleus muscle. The total muscle, fat, and background
volumes were compared between the trained and untrained side. The total muscleand fat tissue content within each region was totaled and a ratio of muscle to fat
volume was calculated.
Muscle Biopsy and Exon Microarray Procedure
The biopsy procedure has been previously described [ 15]. Briefly, percutaneous
muscle biopsies were taken from both the intervention soleus muscle and thecontrol soleus muscle of each subject using a Temno biopsy needle (T1420,
CardinalHealth) under ultrasound guidance within a sterile field. Both limbs were
biopsied at the same time of day. Four passes of the needle were performed toobtain a wide sampling range within the muscle but limit injury to the patient for
safety concerns. Following harvest, muscle biopsy samples were immediately
placed In RNALater (Ambion) and stored at 280
˚C until further use. Total RNA
was extracted using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, as described previously [ 15]. Microarray hybridizations were
performed at the University of Iowa DNA Facility. Briefly, 50 ng of RNA wasconverted to SPIA amplified cDNA using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA
Amplification System, v1 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA, Cat. #3300)
according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The amplified SPIAcDNA product was purified through a QIAGEN MinElute Reaction Cleanup
column (QIAGEN Cat #28204) according to modifications from NuGEN. Four mg
of SPIA amplified DNA were used to generate ST-cDNA using the WT-OvationExon Module v1 (NuGEN Technologies, Cat #2000) and again cleaned up with
the Qiagen column as above. 5 mg of this product were fragmented (average
fragment size 585 bases) and biotin labeled using the NuGEN FL-Ovation cDNA
Biotin Module, v2 (NuGEN Technologies, Cat. #4200) per the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. The resulting biotin-labeled cDNA was mixed with
Affymetrix eukaryotic hybridization buffer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA),placed onto Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Part No. 900650), and incubated at 45
˚C
for 18 h with 60 rpm rotation in an Affymetrix Model 640 GeneChip
Hybridization Oven. Following hybridization, the arrays were washed, stained

with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), signal
amplified with antistreptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame,
CA) using the Affymetrix Model 450 Fluidics Station. Arrays were scanned withthe Affymetrix Model 3000 scanner with 7G upgrade and data were collectedusing the GeneChip operating software (GCOS) v1.4. All microarray data areMIAME compliant and have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus(accession number pending).
Exon Array Data Analysis
The Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays were normalized using a RobustMulti-array Average (RMA) and transformed into a log2 hybridization signal,reflecting the mean signal intensity of all exon probes specific for a particularmRNA transcript using Partek Genomic Suites (v6.6 Copyright /C2232013 Partek
Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The mRNA log2 hybridization signals were further
analyzed using two techniques: a pathway analysis system and expression level
profiling.
The pathway analysis was performed using the gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) algorithm implemented in Partek Genomic Suites(v6.6 Copyright /C2232013
Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) [
44]. The Gene Ontology (GO) biological
process database (version 3.1) was used to cluster differentially expressed genetranscripts to determine whether a particular pathway was likely up or down
regulated in the acute and chronic groups. A false-detection rate (FDR) of 10%,
lower than the recommended 25%, was used to determine those pathwayssignificantly up or down regulated due to the small sample size.
The exon arrays were analyzed using an expression profiling technique, which
compared the mRNA hybridization signals between the acute and chronic groupsrelative to each participant’s control leg. MRNA with a log2 hybridization signal
less than 2 standard deviations away from the mean hybridization signal were
discarded from the dataset, restricting the analysis to mRNA transcripts with highsignal intensity relative to background intensities. A fold-change (FC) wascalculated for each gene transcript in the acute and chronic groups relative to thecontrol limb. A gene transcript was considered to be differentially expressed, if 1)
the FC was greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5 (indicating a 2.0 fold decrease in
expression) and 2) the p-value for the gene was below 0.05 for an independentpaired t-test comparing the stimulated and control. Due to the small sample sizewithin each group, two muscles samples were independently extracted andhybridized for each subject, providing a technical replicate to minimize systematicerrors.
qPCR Procedure and Analysis
Muscle samples were homogenized in lysis buffer using a tissue homogenizer andhard tissue grinding tip (Omni). A column-based RNA extraction wassubsequently performed using the RNEasy Fibrous Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNAse

was included in the protocol to ensure absence of genomic DNA in final samples.
RNA samples were eluted in water and quantified via nanodrop method. In
addition, the quality of each sample was assayed using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. High quality RNA samples were reverse transcribed using iScript
supermix (Bio-Rad). Input quantity of RNA was standardized across all reactions
(500 ng each). All cDNA samples were stored at 286˚C. At the time of qPCR plate
preparation, cDNA samples were diluted five-fold in water and analyzed via SYBR
green technology using a custom PrimePCR plate (Bio-Rad). All samples were
analyzed in duplicate at a final concentration of .5 ng/ mL cDNA per 10 mL
reaction using an ABI 7900 machine. Expression levels were converted to a relative
fold change (FC) of the acutely stimulated or chronically trained limb to thecontrol limb using the comparative C
Tmethod described by Schmittgen and
Livak [ 45]. Beta 2 macroglobulin (B2M) was used as the reference gene because it
demonstrated a consistent expression across all limbs.
Results
Descriptive Analysis of Training Phenotype
The chronically paralyzed muscle phenotype is highly fatigable, slows its
contractile speed during repetitive activation, and potentiates early during
electrical stimulation, findings that are consistent with fast fatigable glycolytic
muscle ( Fig. 1A ). Long term training caused an increase in the lean muscle mass
to adipose tissue ratio when compared to the untrained limb or to the upper thigh
area which was not stimulated ( Fig. 1B ). The muscle hypertrophy following long
term training and the reduced muscle fat are evident using MRI imaging from thetrained and untrained limb of the same subject (
Fig. 1C and 1D ). Note the
increased green marker within the atrophied untrained muscle indicating an
increase of intramuscular fat. The chronic training phenotype also showed less
collagen IV ( Fig. 1E ) and an increase in mitochondria signaling ( Fig. 1G ) when
compared to the same subject’s untrained control limb ( Fig. 1F and 1H ). The
fatigue and contractile properties of the long term trained soleus muscle have been
previously reported [ 6,41,42].
Gene Enrichment Signaling Pathways
We measured over 16,000 mRNA transcripts from each muscle sample obtained.
Using a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% and the gene ontology
(GO) biological process database, we identified 117 and 35 pathways that were
significantly up regulated after an acute dose and chronic dose of electrical
stimulation, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Both the acute and chronic skeletal muscle
groups demonstrated an increase in the expression of genes categorized as
metabolic pathways; however, the genes with increased signal intensity differed
between groups. An acute dose of electrical stimulation up regulated the
expression of genes reported to be transcription factors and co-activators. In

contrast, chronic training up regulated the expression of genes reported to be
oxidative enzymes and metabolic transporter proteins. Many of the up regulated
cell signaling and metabolic pathways involve the same genes (EIF4E, NR4A3,
ABRA, EGR1, PGC-1 A, MYL3, MYH7, TNNT1, and ATP2A2). EIF4E, NR4A3,
ABRA, EGR1, and PGC-1 Aare transcription factors and co-activators important
in maintaining oxidative muscle fibers. MYL3, MYH7, TNNT1, and ATP2A2 are
contractile proteins observed in oxidative and not glycolytic muscle fibers.
Individual Gene Analysis
Over 16,000 mRNA transcripts had a high hybridization signal in both the acute
and chronic groups. Of those, 104 genes had a 2 fold increase in expression and 0
genes had a 2 fold decrease in expression after a single session of electrical muscle
stimulation; however, after chronic stimulation training there were 66 genes with
a 2 fold increase in expression, and 20 genes had a 2 fold decrease in expression.
The top 10 genes with the highest relative fold change ( Table 1 and 2) and lowest
relative fold change ( Table 3 and 4) are listed for the acute and chronic groups,
respectively.
In the acute group, 8 of the top 10 high intensity transcripts function as

ABRA, IFRD1, CYR61, and PGC-1 a). PGC-1 a, NR4A3, IFRD1, FOS, and ABRA
trigger cellular processes needed to shift the muscle toward an oxidative
phenotype, while CYR61 aids in initiating angiogenesis in muscle. PGC-1 a,
NR4A3, EGR1, IFRD1, FOS, and ABRA were over 2 fold higher following an acute
bout of electrical stimulation in paralyzed muscle. In contrast, these genes wereminimally altered in chronically trained paralyzed muscle. In the chronic group, 5
out of the 10 high intensity transcripts function as metabolic enzymes, protein
transporters, and oxidative muscle proteins (MYH6, MYH7, MYL3, MYL2, and
AGBL1). MYH6, MYL3, and MYH7 were at least 3 fold higher in chronically
trained muscle relative to acutely stimulated paralyzed soleus muscle.
Importantly, chronic training decreased genes associated with fast twitch muscle
(ACTN3, MYLK2, and MYL5) and atrophy (MSTN) (
Table 4 ). An acute session
of electrical stimulation triggered a 1.8 fold decrease of MSTN ( Table 3 ), and wasTable 1. Top 10 Expressed mRNA Gene Transcripts Following an Acute Dose of Electrical Muscle Stimulation.

Transcription Factors and Muscle Fiber Types
After a preliminary analysis, we looked at the influence of acute and chronic
soleus stimulation on a subset of genes linked to skeletal muscle phenotypes or
metabolic capacity, specifically targeting genes linked to skeletal muscle
transcription factors, fast-twitch muscle proteins, slow-twitch muscle proteins,
glycolysis enzymes, fatty acid oxidation enzymes, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes,
oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, and mitochondrial fission and fusion
proteins. PGC-1 a(5.46¡0.64, p,0.001), NR4A3(12.45 ¡2.36, p,0.001), and

Glycolysis and Fatty Acid Oxidation
Glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation are the 2 primary pathways used to metabolize
macromolecules in skeletal muscle. PDK4 was increased relative to the controllimb 3 hours after a single session of electrical muscle stimulation training
(3.37¡0.83, p50.008), but was not increased with chronic muscle training

a larger effect observed after chronic electrical muscle stimulation training(

Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and
Mitochondrial Fission/Fusion
The common substrate, acetyl CoA, following aerobic glycolysis or fatty acid
oxidation is further oxidized within mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycleand oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Genes responsible for monocarboxylicacid transport into the mitochondria (BRP44(1.55 ¡0.17, p50.034) and BRP44L
(1.55¡0.19, p50.036)) were increased after chronic electrical muscle stimulation
training and unchanged 3 hours after a single session of electrical musclestimulation (

tricarboxylic acid (OGDH (1.50 ¡0.092, p 50.007) and SDHB (1.54 ¡0.081,

p50.22), and MFN2 (1.35 ¡0.053, p 50.004) aid in regulating mitochondrial
fission and fusion, and were increased with chronic training ( Fig. 5I –L).
qPCR Validation
We verified the expression levels of five genes (ABRA, EGR1, MYH7, NR4A3, and
MSTN) using qPCR. Similar to the exon microarray results, ABRA, EGR1, andNR4A3 expression was increased following an acute dose of electrical stimulationbut was decreased or unchanged in the chronically trained muscle (
Fig. 6 A,B, and
C). Chronically training muscle resulted in a sustained increase of MYH7, while asingle dose of activity minimally altered MYH7 expression (

being seen within the chronically trained muscle ( Fig. 6E ).

expression profile of the chronically trained paralyzed soleus muscle. The
objective of this study was to advance our understanding of the influence of acuteor chronic exercise on regulating gene expression important for metabolic healthof skeletal muscle in humans with paralysis. The major findings of this study are
1) acute stimulation of paralyzed muscle regulates over 100 biological pathways as
compared to less than 30 in chronically trained muscle; 2) acute electricallyinduced exercise up regulates transcriptional, translational, and enzyme regulatorsof metabolic pathways that shift muscle toward an oxidative phenotype (PGC-1 a,
NR4A3, IFRD1, ABRA, PDK4); 3) long term electrically induced exerciseincreased the chronic expression of glycolysis (PDHA1, PDHB, PDHX), fatty acid
oxidation (ACADVL, ACAD8, ACAD9), tricarboxylic acid (BRP44, BRP44L,
OGDH, SDHB), and oxidative genes (NDUFB1, NDUFA2, CYC1, COQ10A); 4)long term electrically induced exercise increased oxidative muscle fiber (MYH6,

MYH7 MYL3, and MYL2) and mitochondrial fission/fusion (MFF, OA1, MFN1,
MFN2) genes, but repressed glycolytic muscle (ACTN3, MYLK2, and MYL5) andmuscle atrophy (MSTN) genes. Taken together, these findings support that the
minimal dose (0.6% of muscle activity per day) of electrically induced exercise
used in this study was sufficient to initiate and maintain several metabolic
pathways in human paralyzed muscle. Whether preserving the metabolic capacity
of skeletal muscle in humans after SCI improves systemic metabolic healthremains unknown.
In 1995, we reported that the acutely paralyzed soleus muscle in humans is
fatigue resistant and oxidative, but transforms into a highly fatigable, glycolytic
muscle after 1 year of paralysis [
4]. Subsequent long term training intervention
studies verified that there was a feasible dose of daily muscle exercise, induced by
electrical stimulation, that could sustain bone mineral density of the underlying
skeletal system [ 6,46,47] and the phenotype of the soleus muscle including its
size, fatigue resistance, muscle oxidative enzymes, reduced post activation
potentiation, and reduced muscle contractile speeds [ 5,6,15,41,42]. The high
incidence of metabolic disease (diabetes) in individuals with SCI [ 10–12],
prompted us to question whether the transformation of paralyzed muscle to the
glycolytic state contributes to the development of systemic metabolic syndromes
consistent with skeletal muscle of people with diabetes [ 9]. We discovered, in this
study, that a moderate dose of acute and chronic electrical stimulation regulatescommon and distinct genes and pathways involved with glucose metabolism.
This study demonstrated that a single dose of electrically induced exercise
stressed muscle and triggered the transcription of genes important for controlling
metabolic pathways. Further, chronic training of paralyzed muscle resulted in a

consistent increase of genes and proteins important for an oxidative, slow-twitch
phenotype. It is noteworthy that skeletal muscle adaptation requires a repetitiveand long term (over a 1 year time) delivery of a stressor in order to up regulate thefull complement of oxidative enzymes necessary to improve muscle endurance [
6]
and reduce muscle fat [ 15,41] (see Fig. 1 ). The minimal dose needed to prevent
skeletal muscle transformation after paralysis is not known. The magnitude of thegene regulation after acute and chronic electrical stimulation in this study isstriking considering the muscle was active for less than 0.6% of the day, while theremainder of the day the muscle experiences little contractile stress.
Two factors likely contributed to the magnitude of gene signaling based on the
design of this protocol. First, the frequency of stimulation was set to create anunfused tetany, which generated ,50% of the maximal muscle force generating
capacity, under isometric conditions. We chose this level of stimulation becausewe believed 50% of maximal force mechanically strains tissues that modulatemuscle signaling and we wished to limit the total force of the muscle to a level thatwould not induce injury to the underlying skeletal and soft-tissues. Second, wesupra maximally activated the muscle, which assured all fibers of the soleus
muscle were activated. This level of muscle activity is unique and specific to
electrical stimulation induced exercise. For example, this dose of exercise cannotbe duplicated in humans under volitional control, as motor unit recruitment, viathe size principle [
48], and rate coding [ 49] will not allow a volitionally driven
muscle to be fully activated at a low firing frequency. Because electricalstimulation exercise recruits motor units differently from volitional exercise, it isrisky to assume that training principles learned from normal volitionally drivenexercise apply to paralyzed muscle exercised through electrical stimulation.
The unique method of stimulating paralyzed muscle induced the peroxisome-
proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-coactivator-alpha (PGC-1 a) gene.
Increased PGC-1 aexpression results in muscle hypertrophy, oxidative, and slow-
twitch protein expression, while decreased levels lead to the conversion toglycolytic proteins and a transformation to a faster-twitch, less oxidative musclefiber [
20,21,50]. In able-bodied individuals, bouts of exercise have been shown to
increase the expression of PGC-1 a, with large increases seen when the muscle has
been metabolically challenged [ 44]. In this study, a single dose of electrical
stimulation challenged the predominantly fast, glycolytic paralyzed muscleresulting in over a 5 fold increase in PGC-1 aexpression. Interestingly, the
chronically trained soleus muscle demonstrated a sustained increase in PGC-1 a
expression when compared to the opposite untrained paralyzed muscle. However,the PGC-1 aexpression was far less than that induced just 3 hours after a single
dose of electrical stimulation. The elevated PGC-1 aexpression in the chronically
trained state suggests that muscle protein adaptations, induced by the repetitivechallenge through chronic training, now prevents the buildup of metabolites(reactive oxygen species) that are known to initiate the cascade of events thatfollow PGC-1 atranscription [
51].
The nuclear orphan receptor-1 (also referred to as NR4A3) assists in regulating
muscle metabolic phenotypes, with increased expression resulting in a more

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0115791 December 22, 2014 17 / 23
oxidative muscle fiber [ 23,24]. Several environmental stressors have been shown
to regulate NR4A3 expression including b-adrenoreceptors, cold, fatty acids,
glucose, insulin, cholesterol, melanocortin, and thiazolidinediones [ 23,24].
However, our single dose of exercise, induced by electrical stimulation, caused
a.5 fold increase in NR4A3 mRNA 3 hours after exercise. Although, this study
did not investigate the specific parameters of electrical stimulation that optimize
the expression of NR4A3, we know that long term use of this stimulation
ultimately leads to less than a 1 fold increase in NR4A3 mRNA expression,
suggesting that NR4A3 plays a role in initiating a metabolic shift, but may be less
important during periods of inactivity.
Actin-binding Rho-activating protein (ABRA) has also been shown to be
instrumental in triggering the transformation of muscle to a more oxidative
muscle fiber phenotype through the activation of the PGC-1 apathway
[21,26,27]. ABRA is located within the sarcomere and is thought to be a critical
link in triggering cellular adaptations by transducing the mechanical stress to
intracellular communication pathways [ 26,52]. Additionally, ABRA has been
shown to translocate to the nucleus and may act as a transcriptional co-activator
or transcription factor [ 21,52]. Interestingly, ABRA expression has been show to
decrease with immobilization and during disuse atrophy [ 26,53] and seems to be
increased in diabetic muscle [ 26,54].
We limited our analysis to genes with a large differential expression ( .2 FC)
compared to the untrained limb. However, limiting to a .2 FC eliminates
transcripts that are differentially expressed but to a lesser magnitude. We explored
genes that did not meet the 2 FC thresholds, but have important roles inregulating oxidative metabolism. BRP44 and BRP44L are two genes that control
the transport of pyruvate from the cytosol to the mitochondria for aerobic
oxidation [
55]. Interestingly, BRP44 and BRP44L were not altered 3 hours after
exercise induced by electrical stimulation. However, with chronic training, both
increased significantly with a .1.5 FC compared to the untrained limb.
The mitochondrion is a critical organelle for skeletal muscle metabolism,
generating over 90% of a cell’s energy [ 56]. The mitochondrial stress response
contributes to the development of insulin resistance [ 57]. In skeletal muscle,
mitochondria form a complex network that may be an indicator of the metabolic
health of a muscle fiber. Mitochondria are regulated by the balance between
mitochondrial fission and fusion [ 56]. The lack of mitochondrial fusion and
excessive mitochondrial fission contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction,
decreasing the oxidative capacity of the muscle fiber [ 56]. Chronic muscle
training, using electrical muscle stimulation, increased the expression ofmitochondrial fusion genes. However, mitochondrial fission genes (DNM1L and
INF2) [
39] were unchanged (data not shown). Interestingly, the mitochondrial
fission and fusion genes were minimally altered 3 hours after a single dose of
muscle activity. However, a single dose of muscle activity significantly increased
the expression of PGC-1 a, which is a key initiator of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Taken together, repeated long-term exposure to the stress of muscle activity is

important to cause cellular adaptations needed to alter the oxidative capacity of a
muscle.
The findings support that exercise, through electrical stimulation, is a powerful
method to stress skeletal muscle. Exercised skeletal muscle has a high oxidativecapacity, and can more rigorously respond to insulin and metabolize glucose[
22,58]. The change in muscle insulin receptor sensitivity associated with routine
exercise may, in part, explain several of the pathways regulated in this study[
51,59–62]. For individuals with SCI, an ability to sustain the size and oxidative
capacity of skeletal muscle may be paramount to improving overall metabolichealth.
Future studies are underway to deliver interventions shortly after the injury that
efficiently regulates skeletal muscle with the goal to optimize the health of peoplewith paralysis. The optimal electrical stimulation dose (frequency, currentintensity, duration, work-rest) to most efficiently/effectively elicit long termcellular adaptations of paralyzed muscle are not known. By targeting specific genesignaling pathways regulated by exercise, future studies may develop ‘‘scientificallygrounded’’ electrical stimulation interventions before initiating expensive andlong-term training programs to restore the metabolic capacity of paralyzedskeletal muscle. Future studies examining various doses of electrical stimulationmay selectively regulate quite different gene signaling pathways and be prescribedbased on the needs of the individual with SCI (hypertrophy vs. metabolism; acutevs. chronic).
Methodological and Clinical Considerations
The results of this study provide a ‘‘snapshot’’ into the effects that a defined doseof muscle activity has on gene regulation in human paralyzed muscle. We used anintervention to sufficiently ‘‘stress’’ the paralyzed muscle while also not injuringthe underlying muscle or skeletal structures. In addition, we used a biopsytechnique that minimized the amount of tissue harvested in order to reduce riskof secondary complications associated with venous stasis in humans withparalysis. We required nearly all of the harvested tissues to sufficiently extract
enough RNA to examine cell signaling pathways, which was the primary objective
of this study. However, this precluded us from carrying out comprehensiveproteomic studies and microscopy studies. Indeed, we do not know how longgene expression was altered after 3 hours or the dose needed to induce an actualchange in protein. We do know that chronic training of ,10 minutes of activity/
day caused a significant change in the functioning phenotype (fatigue, torque,underlying bone tissue) and a stable up regulation of several metabolic signalingpathways. While the number of participants in this study was not large, eachsubject had a control limb serving as a within subject comparison, constituting theidentical genotype to contrast the effects of the electrical stimulation intervention.In addition, the long term trained subjects, while limited in number, represent anovel example of the capacity for muscle tissue to adapt when exposed to a regular(.1 year) but a modest dose of electrically induced exercise (0.6%/day).

Conclusions
A modest dose of acute or chronic electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscle
regulated distinct biological pathways. Taken together, these findings support that
acute and chronic electrical stimulation intervention ( ,10 minutes/day) regulates
key metabolic gene signaling pathways. Early regulation of these pathways after
SCI may assist in preventing diabetes in people with SCI.
