Metabolism consists of a series of reactions that occur within cells of living organisms to
sustain life. The process of metabolism involves many interconnected cellular pathways to
ultimately provide cells with the energy required to carry out their function. The importanceandtheevolutionaryadvantageofthesepathwayscanbeseenasmanyremainunchanged
by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. In eukaryotes, the metabolic pathways occur within
the cytosol and mitochondria of cells with the utilisation of glucose or fatty acids providing
the majority of cellular energy in animals. Metabolism is organised into distinct metabolic
pathways to either maximise the capture of energy or minimise its use. Metabolism can besplit into a series of chemical reactions that comprise both the synthesis and degradation
of complex macromolecules known as anabolism or catabolism, respectively. The basic
principlesofenergyconsumption andproductionarediscussed, alongsidethebiochemicalpathways that make up fundamental metabolic processes for life.
Introduction
The basics of metabolism
Whenmanypeoplethinkaboutmetabolism,theythinkoffoodanddrinkorthehugemetabolicpathwaydiagram with thousands of connections. However, understanding metabolism is key to understanding
lifeandthishasbeenasubjectoffascinationwithbiochemistsformorethan150years.ThegreatNobel
Prize-winning scientist Hans Krebs was inspired to study metabolism by his university professor ProfFrance Knoop (who discovered β-oxidation of fatty acids). He unpicked and described both the citric
acidcycleandtheureacyclewhichlieasfundamentalprocessesofmetabolism.ProfFranzKnoopsaid:

glycogen).
This review will focus on the basics of metabolism with in mammals, with mentions of other organisms too. The
aim is to provide you with an understanding of the metabolic pathways that are present in animals, how energy isderived from these systems, and how they are controlled. Finally, we will touch on the exciting elements of research
in metabolism, including how understanding metabolism could help with treating cancer, how it can be used in
biotechnologytogeneratebioethanol,andhowmetabolicdiseasesmakeupseveralkeyinheritedconditions.
Why pathways?
Metabolic pathways are vital in capturing useful energy. This is in contrast with uncontrolled combustion, where
energyisrapidlyreleasedintotheenvironment,asheatandlight,whichwouldbeunsustainableforlife.Metabolismis

metabolic reactions occurring simultaneously within the cell and occurring at a relatively low temperature. Most
of this is achieved by specific enzymes and compartmentalisation of reactions and enzymes. Sometimes this com-
partmentalisation is achieved by separating reactions into different organelles, or by coupling reactions together, toprevent uncontrolled combustion. Enzymes allow discrete reactions to occur, which when combined give the same
overall effect as combustion, but in a controlled fashion. In this review, we will discuss the energy of reactions, the
roleofmetabolicenzymes,keymetabolicpathways,andthenthevitalorganellesforenergygeneration.
Energy within the system
One of the most important biomolecules in the cell is the nucleotide; ATP. ATP has a linear triphosphate structure
whichprovidesfournegativechargesandthereforeitexistsasahighlychargedmolecule.Duetothisnegativecharge,
these bonds can store a large amount of energy, which can be liberated easily at the site of work. Along with ATP,NAD

If you increase the concentration of A and B, this pushes the reaction to make more C and D. If you do the opposite and add more
C and D, then the reverse reaction occurs. The aim is to bring the reaction back to equilibrium.

we still want to know if the reaction is going in one direction or the other. Change in free energy ( /Delta1G) is a much
more realistic measure of the energy available to the system under normal cellular environments. This is because in

and biotechnological applications ( Essays in Biochemistry (2015), 59, 1–41; DOI: 10.1042/bse0590001).
Coupled reactions and pathways
There is an intrinsic value to coupling reactions together to form complex pathways. As we can see from Table 1,
several reactions have a positive /Delta1G and so in theory, should not be spontaneous nor go in reverse. However, by
linking the reactions together, the product of one reaction becomes the substrate for the next. Thus, by coupling
reactions together, substrates can build up and products can be rapidly removed, changing the equilibrium seesaw

Metabolism from thin air
Organismsfallintotwodistinctgroups,eitherheterotrophsorautotrophs.Autotrophsderivedfromthewords‘auto’for ‘self’ and ‘-trophs’ for ‘food’ are a set of organisms that can obtain energy from sunlight and inorganic nutrients

Autotrophs can generally be split into two groups, chemoautotrophs, and photoautotrophs. These organisms use
the energy from inorganic chemical reactions (chemoautotrophs, i.e. Nitrobacter ) or light (photoautotrophs, i.e.
plants) to fix carbon dioxide as a usable energy source. One example of a key group of chemoautotrophs are the
diazotrophs, which are nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea. They are responsible for fixing nitrogen from the air
(N

also capable of using these compounds to obtain energy for biosynthesis of macromolecules. Ammonia-oxidising

Metabolic fuels are selectively metabolised
The tissues of the body show differing abilities to utilise various metabolic fuels, and most show flexibility in fuel
selection. For several tissues, glucose is the main fuel, but others, including the heart, can use a wide range of fuels.
The human brain relies almost completely on glucose to meet the high energy demand, with a small amount ofketonesused duringstarvation.It isestimatedthatat rest thebrainuses nearlytwo-thirdsof glucoseconsumption,

Hormonal control of metabolism
In mammals, metabolism can also be controlled by an interplay between the small peptide hormones: insulin and

function in the liver, it is also able to significantly increase glucose uptake in peripheral tissue. Insulin binds to theinsulin receptor (a tyrosine kinase receptor) on the cell surface which autophosphorylates and recruits the insulin
receptor substrate (IRS). IRS then initiates the signallingtransductionpathway, which eventually leads to the phos-

Theenzymaticprocessofglycolysisoccurswithinthecytosolandcanbedividedintotwodefinitivestagesofenergyinvestmentandenergyrecovery(Figure9).
Stage I energy investment phase
The first reaction of glycolysis is catalysed by hexokinase (or glucokinase in the liver and pancreas), involving the
transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to glucose, forming G6P. G6P is isomerised to F6P by G6PI and is thenfurther phosphorylated by PFK, to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). This phosphorylation step is irreversible
and utilises the second ATP molecule in glycolysis. Aldolase catalyses the cleavage of FBP (6-carbon molecule) to
formtwo3-carbonmoleculesGAPanddihydroxyacetonephosphate(DHAP).Anotherisomerase,triosephosphate
isomerase(TIM),catalysestheinterconversionbetweenDHAPandGAP,allowingDHAPtoconvertintoGAP,and
proceed along the glycolytic pathway. As a result, for every glucose molecule, two molecules of GAP are produced.Therefore,fromthisstageonwards,allintermediatesandby-productsaredoubledinproduction.

Gluconeogenesis
The importance of gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis is an anabolic process whereby glucose is formed from non-carbohydrate carbon precursors in-cludingpyruvate.Thegluconeogenicpathwaylargelyoccurswithintheliverandkidneystomaintainbloodglucose

Regulation of glucose metabolism by gene expression
One of the actions of insulin is to increase glycolysis, whilst suppressing gluconeogenesis (in the liver). In re-
sponse to increased insulin and glucose, the mammalian liver, muscle, and peripheral tissue increases the expres-sion of GLUT1–4, hexokinase/glucokinase and key glycolytic genes: GAP dehydrogenase, PK and the bifunctional
enzyme (which stimulates PFK activity). To suppress gluconeogenesis in the liver, insulin decreases the expression
of glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and EP carboxylase. This alteration in gene expression pat-tern, increases glucose utilised in the cells, and maintains glycolytic activity. In the mammalian liver, glucose can
increasetheexpressionofPKviathetranscriptionfactorknownascarbohydrate-responsiveelementbindingprotein
(ChREBP).Interestingly,theactionofglucagonontheliversuppressesthistranscriptionfactor,therebyreducingtheexpressionofPK.
Glycogen
What is glycogen?
Glycogen is a large, multibranched polysaccharide of glucose. It contains α-1,4-glycosidic bonds between adjacent

The importance of glycogen
Glycogen can be degraded to supply energy to the body. This is specifically important as cells within the brain rely
almost entirely on glucose for energy and therefore glucose released from liver cells can help supply this. Withinperiods of sudden activity, such as sprinting, the glucose obtained from glycogen degradation can produce enough
energywhennooxygenisinitiallyavailable.
Furthermore,thequestion‘whycannotallexcessfuelsinthehumanbodybestoredasfattyacids?’isusuallyprobed.

thebreakdownofglycogenishighlycontrolled.Therefore,thesubsequentreleaseofglucoseisalsocontrolledtohelp
raiseormaintainbloodglucoselevels.
Synthesis and degradation
The synthesis of glycogen requires an activated form of glucose called uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose).
This is formed by the addition of UTP to glucose-1-phosphate. UDP-glucose is added to the non-reducing end ofglycogen,expandingitssize.
The degradation of glycogen requires the release of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen and the remodelling of
glycogensubstratestowarrantfurtherdegradation.Glucose-1-phosphateisthenconvertedintoG6Pwhichhassev-eralfateswithinmetabolism.

ThefateofpyruvateandNADHisdependentontheconditionswithinthecell.Inthepresenceofoxygen,pyruvate
isoxidisedcompletelyatthemitochondria,toformcarbondioxideandwatertoyieldATPmolecules.However,where
oxygen is absent, anaerobic respiration occurs. In animal tissues, such as muscle, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by
homolacticfermentationduetolactatedehydrogenase(LDH).ThisregeneratesNAD+moleculesforthecontinuation
of glycolysis and the subsequent formation of 2 ATP molecules. Anaerobic respiration therefore only synthesises 2
ATPmoleculeswhich,incomparisonwiththe30–32ATPmoleculesyieldedinaerobicrespiration,isfarlessefficient.
Therefore,energyfromanaerobicrespirationisnotsustainableforwholeorganismuse(inmammals)butisinsteadrequired for individual cell survival. For example, erythrocytes lack mitochondria and so rely solely on anaerobic
respiration for energy. In the case of erythrocytes, this is highly advantageous as it means that they do not use the

(YADH).
Aerobic fate of pyruvate
Followingglycolysis,underaerobicconditions,pyruvateisoxidisedtoformacetylCoA,whichthenenterstheTCAcycle to further cellular respiration in cells. This reaction is catalysed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and is acrucial convergence point between the TCA cycle and glycolysis, lipid, and amino acid metabolic pathways. PDH
is regulated based on the demand of the cell for the use of carbohydrates as energy. Where carbohydrate stores are
depleted, PDH activity is down-regulated to diminish the use of glucose via oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore,other sources of energy, such as fatty acids and ketone bodies, can be used in various tissue types such as the heart
andmuscle.
Pyruvate +CoA+NAD

Structurally, PDH exists as three subunits: E1, E2, and E3. Regulation of PDH occurs at serine residues within
subunitE1,whereitsactivityisinhibitedthroughreversiblephosphorylationatthesesites.PDHkinases(PDK1–4)
catalyse this phosphorylation reaction and therefore inhibits PDH activity. On the other hand, PDH phosphatases
(PDP1 and PDP2) catalyse the reverse dephosphorylation reaction to restore PDH activity. The kinases and phos-phatases are respectively differentially expressed in a multitude of tissues within the body. The activity of these en-

Figure 11. The chemical structural differences amongst saturated, monosaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids
Saturated fatty acids hold no double bond within their structure meaning the carbon atoms are fully ‘saturated’ with hydrogens.Monounsaturated fats have one carbon–carbon double bond in their structure and polyunsaturated hold two or more.
Acetyl CoA is a molecule that lies at the hub of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Its main function is to

Mammals consume TAGs within our diet. As they are consumed, the small intestine packages these fats into
protein carrier molecules called chylomicrons. These are eventually released into the lymphatic system where

The yin and yang of fatty acids
As listed above, we consume fats within our diet. Fats exist here as either saturated or unsaturated. Unsaturated fatscanbefurtherdividedintomonounsaturatedorpolyunsaturated.Thedifferencebetweenthesethreegroupsoffats
is based on their chemical structure, which ultimately determines whether they hold beneficial or harmful effects
withinourbody.Thestructureoffatsisultimatelyalonghydrocarbonchainbondedtoaglycerolbackbone.
Saturatedfats,suchaspalmiticacid,areharmfultoourbody.Itisoftenfoundinbutter,lard,andcheese.Saturated
fats tip the balance between low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) to favour LDL
concentration, which is harmful. Consuming large amounts of saturated fat within the diet is associated with anincreasedriskofheartdisease,stroke,andtype2diabetes.Withintheirstructure,theycontainalongsingle-bonded
carbonchainwithlotsofhydrogenatomsasshowninFigure11.
In opposition, unsaturated fats are beneficial when consumed. They are found within vegetables, nuts, and fish
and are liquid at room temperature. Their chemical structure contains less hydrogen to carbon bonds due to the
presenceofdoublebondsbetweencarbonatomswithintheirtailchain.Monounsaturatedfatsfoundwithinoliveoil,peanuts,andavocadoscontainonecarbon-to-carbondoublebondwithintheirstructures.Whereaspolyunsaturated
fats, such as sunflower oil and those found within salmon, contain two or more carbon double bonds within their
structure (Figure 11). These fats can increase levels of HDLs within humans, reducing the chance of heart disease,stroke,anddiabetes.Somestudiesclaimedthatincreasingthesefatscantreatsomeofthelisteddiseasesabove.

Fatsaretakenupintothecytosolfromthebloodstream,eitherdiffusingacrossthemembrane,oractivelybyspecific

Fatty acids are initially ‘activated’ in the cytosol and then transported over the outer and inner mitochondrial
membranes for fatty acid oxidation to proceed. The activation of fatty acids begins with the reaction of fatty acids
with CoA to create Acyl CoA, a reaction catalysed by acyl synthetase (thiokinase). This reaction is coupled to a

This is also controlled on a gene level in the mammalian liver and peripheral tissue, where increased fatty acid
uptakeintocellscausesfattyacidbindingtothetranscriptionfactorPPAR α.ThePP AR α–fattyacidcomplexforms
a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR), which binds to PPAR response elements and leads to the increased
expression of CPT1, liver fatty acid bindingprotein(FABP) andfattyacid β-oxidation genes. As mentionedearlier,
PPARαalso potentially decreases glucose oxidation by increasing the expression of the PDH inhibitor, PDK4. The
process of PPAR αactivation by fatty acids, means that an increase in fatty acid availability is met by an increase in
metabolismoffattyacids.
Fatty acid β-oxidation
Fatty acid β-oxidation is the mitochondrial aerobic process of breaking down a fatty acid into acetyl CoA, NADH,
and FADH 2.A sw eh a v ej u s ts e e n ,f a t t ya c i d sa r es i m p l el i p i d sa n du s u a l l yh a v eal o n gh y d r o c a r b o nc h a i nw i t ha

a time, starting from the carboxylic acid end. The product formed by its breakdown ultimately feeds into the TCA
acidcycle.
Fatty acid β-oxidationoccurswithinthemitochondrialmatrix(Figure12).Initially,fattyacylCoAisoxidisedby
FAD to form trans-enoylCoA,whereadehydrogenationreactionremovestwohydrogenmoleculesbetweencarbon
2 and 3 of the fatty acid chain. Next, the hydration step adds a water molecule across the double bond forming hy-
droxyacyl CoA. The next NAD-dependent dehydrogenation step generates an NADH molecule and ketoacyl CoA.Eventually, a thiolytic cleavage reaction forms an acetyl CoA molecule and acyl CoA that is 2 carbons shorter in
length.ThisacylCoAcanberecycledandreusedcyclicallyfor β-oxidationoffattyacids.

Figure 14. The categorisation of amino acids into their essential, conditional and non-essential groups in humans
Conditional amino acids are not usually essential amino acids, only in times of illness and stress. Essential amino acids are notproduced naturally by the body and must come from dietary intake whereas non-essential amino acids are produced by our body.
Amino acid metabolism
What are amino acids and where do they come from?
Amino acids are organic compounds that are composed of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, along with a
variable side chain. Amino acids are the individual monomers that make up proteins, nucleotide bases (used for
DNA, RNA, and ATP synthesis) and other nitrogenous products. As we have already seen in times of starvation,
amino acid metabolism can be vital to maintain glucose levels and provide alternative carbon sources. Amino acidscanbeconsumedfromdietarysourcesorsynthesisedwithinourbodiesandarecategorisedonthisbasis,respectively
(Figure14).
Amino acid transamination
Excess amino acids that are not required within the body are excreted as they cannot be stored. The metabolism ofa m i n oa c i d soc cu r sp r ed o m i n a n tl ywi th i nth el i v e rh o w ev e r ,th eki d n ey ,m u sc l e s ,a n da d i po seti s s u e sal soca rryo u t

Krebs found that certain organic acids were readily oxidised by muscle, whereas the oxidation of carbohydrates
andpyruvatewasstimulatedbythepresenceofspecificorganicacids.Theseacidshappenedtobetheintermediates

Furthermore,usingmalonate,aninhibitorofsuccinatedehydrogenase,inmusclesuspensionexperiments,Krebs
found an accumulation of succinate in the presence of citrate isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, malate, and ox-
aloacetate. He, therefore, deemed a cyclic nature of all of these reactions to lead to succinate. This was proposed by
Krebsin1937forwhichhewontheNobelPrizeinPhysiologyorMedicinein1953.

Mitochondria are dynamic
MitochondriaareoftenthoughtofasthestaticstructurepresentedinFigure18,butinreality,theycanexistindifferentforms.Fluorescentlytaggedneuronalmitochondriahavebeenvisualisedmovingfromtheneuronalbody,alongthecytoskeleton of the axon and to the synapse where energy demand is high. Whilst mitochondria can be present as
single mitochondrion, they can also form long connected networks similar to chains seen in some prokaryotes (e.g.
cyanobacteria).Inthesenetworks,mitochondriacanundergofission(splitting)andthenre-join(fusion),dependingon energetic demand and mitochondrial health. This act of fusion is thought to help recycle or refresh damaged
mitochondria and allow mutations in mitochondrial DNA and damage to enzymes to be diluted throughout the
network.Infactdefectsingenesregulatingfissionandfusion(forexamplePINK1andParkin),havebeenreportedin neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Mutations in these genes (and others) lead to mitochondrial
undergoing higher levels of fission and are less able to fuse, thereby not recycling damaged mtDNA or metabolic
enzymes,affectingneuronalhealthandviability.

There are two entry points into the ETC, this is either via NADH + H+and complex I or succinate/FADH 2and
complex II. Ultimately, both pathways deliver electrons into the ETC and generate ATP at the end. However, the

The discovery of the urea cycle
The urea cycle was discovered by Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit in 1932 and was the first metabolic cycle to beelucidated.
Initially, it was found that, in liver slices, urea synthesis occurred at high rates in the presence of ornithine and
ammoniumions.EventhoughKrebsandHenseleitwerescepticalofthis,itwasdeemedthattheremaybeapotentiallinkwiththepresenceofarginasewithintheliver .Arginaseisanenzymethatconvertedarginineintoornithineand

The urea cycle
Themainfunctionoftheureacycleistodetoxifyexcessammonium(NH 4+)intoanon-toxiccompoundcalledurea
(Figure 21). The first stages of the cycle occur within the mitochondrial matrix of hepatocytes. Ammonia travels tothe liver in the bloodstream in the form of alanine and glutamine or via the hepatic portal vein from the gut. The
initial reaction includes the formation of a carbomoyl phosphate molecule which then combines with ornithine to
form citrulline. For this reaction to occur, ornithine moves into the mitochondrial matrix from the cytosol via anornithine transporter. Once formed, citrulline moves into the cytosol via a citrulline transporter in exchange for
cytosolicornithine,whichultimatelybeginsthecycle.

In the cytosol, citrulline is condensed with aspartate to form argininosuccinate driven by the hydrolysis of ATP.
Argininosuccinate is cleaved to arginine and fumarate, a reaction that is catalysed by argininosuccinate lyase. In as t a t eo ff a s t i n gw h e ng l u c o n e o g e n e s i so c c u r s ,f u m a r a t ec a nb eu s e dt of o r mm a l a t ew h i c hc a nt h e ng oo nt of o r m

The role of metabolism in inherited diseases
Metabolic processes that have been discussed extensively within this review largely oversimplify and underestimate
thepervasiveroleofmetabolisminalllivingorganisms.Thediscoveryandbreakdownofindividualmetabolicpath-
ways have been at the forefront of scientific research for many years up until the 1960s. Since then research into
the role of metabolism has been largely driven by the recognition of metabolic perturbations and their manifesta-tion in human diseases. As metabolism is essential for life, disruptions or dysregulation in metabolic processes can
be detrimental. Certain mutations in metabolic enzymes can be embryonically lethal in mouse knockout studies,
demonstrating the curial role that metabolic pathways play in life. Metabolic perturbations underlie many humandiseases and here we will briefly discuss metabolic processes that occur within inborn errors of metabolism, which
leadtoinheriteddiseases.

presence of oxygen, do not continue with oxidative phosphorylation but instead increase lactate production. This
cellular metabolic adaptation in cancer cells is referred to as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect (Figure 23).S i m i l a rt ow h a ti ss e e ni nr e db l o o dc e l l s .T h er e s u l t i n gl a c t a t eo v e r p r o d u c t i o nw o u l dp r o v o k eas t a t eo fm e t a b o l i c

To target glucose oxidation, the drug dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits PDK, which causes the activation of PDH
and an increase in acetyl CoA. PDH activation allows mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate to occur, disrupting the
metabolic glycolytic advantage of cancer cells. Furthermore, DCA acts to counter the acidosis caused by increased
lactateproductionbydecreasingflowthroughLDH,inhibitingtheprogressionanddevelopmentofthetumourmi-croenvironment.Therefore,drugtherapieshaveshowntheabilitytotargetthealteredcellularmetabolicpathwaysin

The importance of metabolism in biotechnology
The potential of metabolism
Along with drug discovery and diagnosis of human diseases, metabolism plays an exciting role in the developmentofbiotechnology.Whetherthatisbio-engineeringof Escherichiacoli tomeetthegrowingdemandforbioethanolor
manipulating plants to generate better defence against pests, there are lots of possibilities. Advancements of knowl-edgeintheseparticularfieldshaveallowedthedevelopmentofmorespecificbiotechnologicaladvancements.These
advancements allow us to overcome hurdles that once caused issues with yield and even resistance. These ideas
are discussed below as how biotechnology has ensured efficient and elaborate systems to target particular areas ofmetabolism.
Bioethanol production from E. coli
Ethanol holds a variety of applications in the food, chemical, medical, and health industry and is commonly used
inbeverages,fuels,andpaint.Ethanolislargelyproducedfromcoalandpetroleumusingnon-renewableprocesses;
however, ethanol can be produced by fermentation of sugars and starch. Microorganisms hold the capacity to pro-duceethanolviafermentationandduetothis,havebeenidentifiedandstudiedtoproduceethanolinhighcapacity.
Microorganisms can be metabolically engineered to redirect carbon sources to desired fuel products. One of these
microorganismsis E.coli.
E.colican naturallyutilisea variety of carbon sources such as sugars and sugar alcohols, under both aerobic and
anaerobic conditions. All biofuels that are derived from E.coliare derived from the modification of central carbon
catabolismincludingtheconversionofpentose/hexosesugarmoleculesintodiatomiccarbon.
E. colican produce ethanol under anaerobic conditions to produce 1 mole of ethanol for every 1 mole of glu-
coseused,alongsideformateandacetate.Thereductionreactionthatoccurstosynthesisethese,utilisestwoNADH
molecules but the initial stages of glycolysis only yield one. This causes a redox imbalance. This redox imbalance isovercome by E.coliby balancing the production of ethanol by oxidation of acetyl CoA into acetate, which requires
no NADH. These E.coliwere engineeredto express pyruvate decarboxylase and alcoholdehydrogenase II genes of
Zymomonasmobilis . This pathway produces 95% ethanol, without a redox imbalance as it only requires 1 NADH
molecule.
Modiﬁcation of metabolism in plants
Plantmetabolismishighlyorganisedandcontrolledbyinnateregulationsalongsidehomoeostaticmechanisms.Their
metabolicproceduresarehighlycompartmentalisedwhereeachorganellecarriesoutaspecificmetabolicfunction.
Within nature, plants are constantly challenged by insect herbivores. In response to this, as a defence to reduce
insect-relateddamagetotheplant,theyproducetoxinsandsmalldeterrentmoleculesforprotection.Someofthese
defence responses are inducible where these are related to the up-regulation or down-regulation of metabolites and
proteinsinresponsetoanattack.
For example, the tobacco plant naturally synthesises nicotine to deter insects from eating them. However, if an
attackdoesoccuronatobaccoplant,thisresponseisup-regulated.Here,therootssynthesiselargeamountsofnico-
tine,andthisistransportedtotheshoot.Thisresponseisregulatedbyjasmonicacidandauxin,bothsignalsthataretriggeredbywounding.Thisincreaseinnicotineproductionistoavoidfurtherherbivoreattack.
In addition to defences such as those described above, plants can also induce changes in their metabolism in re-
sponsetoattacks.Theseincludeelevatingordecreasingtheirphotosyntheticefficiency,remobilisationofcarbonandnitrogenresourcesalongsidealteringtheirplantgrowth.
Amino acids are the form of nitrogen found in plants. They can regulate plant growth and are precursors for
defence-related metabolites. When plants are infested by herbivore insects, studies found that amino acid produc-tion increased to synthesise defensive metabolites to ensure a second attack does not occur. This increase in amino
acidproductionoccursasgenesinvolvedinaminoacidsynthesisareup-regulatedandsulphurassimilation,whichis
ultimatelyrequiredforthebiosynthesisofcysteineandmethionine,areallup-regulateduponcaterpillarfeedingon
Arabidopsisthaliana .Furtheringthis,asimilarstudyfurtherfoundthattheincreasedexpressionofgenesinvolved
inaminoacidbiosynthesis,inparticular,relatedtomethionineandtryptophansynthesis,ledtoagreateraccumula-tion of glucosinolates. These are defence-related molecules that are derived from methionine and tryptophan in A.

Plant biotechnology is a set of techniques that are used to adapt plants for survival and defence. One of the most
effective ways to manage plant pathogenicity is to use genetic modification alongside genome editing. This is par-
ticularly usefulin the agricultureindustry to ensure increasedfood supply. Globally, up to 30% of food is damaged
bypathogensanddiseasepests.Therefore,theadaptationofplantstopathogensandpestsisimperativeforsurvival.Gene modification and genome editing can help manage plant pathogens to ensure plant cell survival in times of
attack,thesesolutionscurrentlyincludebacterial,viral,fungal,andoomycetepathogens.
Asknowledgeregardingtheplantimmunesystemhasexpanded,ithasbeenshownthatplantscandistinguishbe-
tween ‘self’ and ‘non-self’ through monitoring the extracellular and intracellular environment. However, pathogens
can overcome this system by producing proteins and effectors to suppress plant host immunity and colonise it. A
bacterialpathogencanhijackthecoronatine-insensitiveprotein1jasmonatereceptor,alteringtheplant’sdefencere-sponseandactivatingjasmonateresponsesandsuppressingsalicylicaciddefencepathways.Manipulationlikethese
has allowed the development of biotechnology to intervene at the point of pathogen perception. These can be cre-
ated by introducing receptors from other plants with novel recognition specificity, reactivation of genes disabled in
NOD-likereceptors,andmodificationofdomainsinNOD-likereceptorsthataretargetedbypathogens.Thisknowl-
edge reveals which components of the host can be manipulated to promote a disease state. Therefore, by removingthesevulnerablepointsorreplacingthemwithvariantsthatareimmunetospecificeffectors,thenaturalfunctional-
ityoftheplantcanberetained.Bacterialpathogens,thatexpressthetranscriptionactivatelikeeffectorsthatactivate
susceptibility genes within the host, can be overcome by the deletion of TAL DNA-binding sites in the promoter.AnotherapproachincludesengineeringresistancetobacterialpathogensbyaddingTALeffectorbindingsitestoan

Conclusion
At least 25 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work related to metabolism, with the most recent for the
oxygen-sensingroleofHIF1 αin2019.Thisreviewhasintroducedthebasicmetabolicpathwaysoflifeanddemon-
strated how a series of reactions can combine to sustain life. Over the last 150–200 years, the understanding ofmetabolismhasmovedfromindividualenzymesandmetabolitestothecomplicatednetworkweseetoday.Thishas
allowed us to visualise metabolismoccurringin real-timewithin thehuman body, to help us understand metabolic
alterations in human disease. Manipulation of metabolic pathways in both microorganisms and plants has also ledthewayinthedevelopmentofnewbiotechnologicaltechniques.
