I suggest that this shortening is accomplished by titin binding to actinand that the trigger for titin-actin interactions is associated with the formation ofstrongly bound cross bridges between actin and myosin that exposes actin attach-ment sites for titin through movement of the regulatory proteins troponin andtropomyosin.

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
Striated muscles are thought to have three basic mechanical
properties: the force-length relationship (e.g., 15), the force-velocity relationship (e.g., 28), and the history-dependent prop-erties of residual force enhancement and force depression (e.g.,1). These properties are typically considered to be associated,in one way or another, with the active force production of thecross bridges. However, passive properties play a signiﬁcantrole in the force-length relationship of skeletal and cardiacmuscles, and passive properties have also received renewedattention for their potential role in the force enhancementproperty (23, 25).
In this brief opinion paper, I focus on the passive force
enhancement in striated muscle. However, before doing that, itis essential to deﬁne and understand the residual force enhance-ment property for appropriate context. Residual force enhance-ment is deﬁned as the increase in active, steady-state, isometricforce of a muscle following active stretching (eccentric action)compared with the corresponding (same length and sameactivation) active, steady-state, isometric force of a muscle
whose length was not changed (Fig. 1).
Residual force enhancement was ﬁrst studied systematically
by Abbott and Aubert (1952) (1) in isolated frog, toad, anddogﬁsh muscles. Their results were then reproduced and con-ﬁrmed for all structural levels of muscle including voluntaryand electrically activated human skeletal muscles (e.g., 17, 47,69), isolated muscle ﬁbers (e.g., 10, 45), single myoﬁbrils (e.g.,37, 49, 65), and single sarcomeres (e.g., 48).
Residual force enhancement has been shown to increase
with increasing magnitudes of stretching but is largely inde-pendent of the speed of stretching (e.g., 6, 10, 30). Further-more, force enhancement is long lasting (minutes in skinnedﬁbers and single myoﬁbrils) but can be abolished instanta-neously when a muscle is deactivated and active force isallowed to drop to zero (e.g., 1, 60). Finally, force enhance-ment is associated with a decrease in metabolic cost (per unit
of force produced) compared with the cost of force for a purelyisometric contraction (36) but is not associated with a changein muscle stiffness (e.g., 72), indicating that force enhancementis not achieved by a greater proportion of attached crossbridges.
Several molecular and subcellular mechanisms have been
proposed for explaining the residual force enhancement prop-erties of skeletal muscles. For a detailed review, the interested

reader is referred to Herzog (2018) (27) and Herzog et al.
(2016) (26). However, two mechanisms have received moreattention than the others. The ﬁrst of these, the so-calledsarcomere length nonuniformity theory (e.g., 59, 60), explainsresidual force enhancement within the boundaries of the two-ﬁlament cross bridge theory (31, 33, 34, 66). Brieﬂy, accordingto the sarcomere length nonuniformity theory, residual forceenhancement is caused by the development of vast sarcomerelength nonuniformities when a muscle is actively stretched onthe descending limb of the force-length relationship (29, 58).However, many primary predictions of this theory (e.g., forceenhancement cannot occur on the ascending part of the force-length relationship, force enhancement cannot exceed the pla-teau force of the force-length relationship, force enhancementcannot occur in a single sarcomere or half-sarcomere, isometricreference forces occur with essentially uniform sarcomerelengths, and sarcomere length nonuniformity increases withactive muscle stretching) have been shown to be violated (e.g.,32, 35, 45, 48, 56, 57, 63). Therefore, it appears untenable tosupport the sarcomere length nonuniformity theory as themechanism explaining the residual force enhancement prop-erty.
The second mechanism that has been proposed for explain-
ing the residual force enhancement property of striated musclesis associated with the engagement of a passive structuralelement. Proponents of this mechanism have argued that re-sidual force enhancement can be explained readily with the“engagement” of a passive structural muscle element uponmuscle activation (11, 12, 62). How this engagement mightoccur, or what structures may be involved, had not beenidentiﬁed for a long time. As a consequence of this engage-ment, forces arising from this passive structure were thought tobe greater when a muscle was stretched actively compared withwhen it was stretched passively.
One of the ﬁrst scientists to mention such a possibility was
Paul Edman, who argued that the dependence of force en-hancement on stretch magnitude and independence fromstretch speed could readily be explained with the engagement
of a parallel elastic element upon activation (10). However,Edman’s own experiments on shortening-stretch cycles per-formed in single, intact frog ﬁbers did not support the existenceof such a passive mechanism (10). Noble (62) was among theﬁrst to suggest that the passive structural muscle componentthat could cause residual force enhancement was the sarco-meric, ﬁlamentous, spring protein titin. Noble realized that titinwas perfectly placed in the sarcomere to fulﬁll such a role, butdirect evidence of an “engagement of titin upon activation”was lacking at the time. Theoretical modeling before theexperimental discovery of titin’s role in residual force enhance-ment revealed that, indeed, the engagement of a parallel elasticelement upon muscle activation could readily explain many ofthe basic features of residual force enhancement and forcedepression (12). However, there was no direct evidence of theinvolvement of a passive element contributing to force en-hancement until we discovered, rather serendipitously, what isnow referred to as the “passive force enhancement” (23).
PASSIVE FORCE ENHANCEMENT
Discovery
Passive force enhancement was ﬁrst discovered and de-
scribed in detail for the cat soleus muscle (23). We performedexperiments aimed at quantifying the amount of force enhance-ment at different muscle lengths, including long muscle lengthsat which the muscle produced passive forces naturally. Whenstretching the soleus muscle actively to lengths of naturallyoccurring passive forces, we observed that after deactivationthese actively stretched muscles had a greater passive forcethan the muscles that were stretched passively to that samelengths or muscles that were activated isometrically at the longlengths (Fig. 1). I remember vividly that we thought we hadmade a mistake and pulled the muscle to a length greater thanthe isometric reference length, as we could not explain other-wise why the passive force was systematically greater afteractive compared with passive stretching of a muscle. However,once such an error had been eliminated, we studied thisincreased passive force following active stretching carefullyand concluded that it was part of the total force enhancementobserved in these tests (24, 25, 38, 39, 46). We called thisnewly discovered property of muscle “passive force enhance-ment,” and the name has been adopted universally by thescientiﬁc community. After publication of our 2002 results, wesearched for evidence of this property and found that it hadbeen observed many times before (e.g., 60) but had beenignored, probably because it was “just” passive force thatoccurred after the “real” experiment was long done. Throughthe discovery of the passive force enhancement, I learned thatit is crucial in science to have an open mind and be ready to payattention to unexpected results, even if they may not be a partof the objectives you were pursuing with your experiments.Serendipity and chance favor the prepared mind.
Deﬁnition
We deﬁned passive force enhancement as the increase in
steady-state passive force observed after stretching of an activemuscle and subsequent deactivation, compared with the corre-sponding (same length) passive force observed after stretchingof a passive muscle (Fig. 1) (23).

conditions for a cat soleus muscle (35°C). Bottom trace (at 4 s) is a passive
stretch of the soleus, where stretching occurs between ~2.5 and 3.5 s. Middle
trace (at 4 s) represents an isometric contraction at the stretched length. Finally,toptrace (at 4 s) represents stretching of the activated muscle in the same
manner as the passive stretch (same magnitude and same speed of stretching).FE indicates the residual force enhancement, which is the increase in steady-state isometric force after active muscle stretching compared with the corre-sponding (same length, same activation) isometric force for a purely isometriccontraction. PFE indicates the passive force enhancement, which correspondsto the increase in steady-state passive force following stretching of an activatedmuscle compared with the same stretching of the passive muscle.1783 PASSIVE FORCE ENHANCEMENT IN MUSCLE

Properties
Passive force enhancement has been shown to occur primar-
ily at muscle lengths where passive forces occur naturally (23),has been shown to be long lasting, but can be abolishedinstantaneously when a muscle is shortened to its initial (pre-stretch) length and pulled back to its ﬁnal (poststretch) length(25) (Fig. 2 A). Passive force enhancement increases with
increasing stretch magnitudes (Fig. 2 B), is typically equal to or
smaller than the total residual force enhancement (24), sug-gesting that it is a component, but not the exclusive cause, ofthe residual force enhancement, and increases with the amountof force during stretch (24). Passive force enhancement hasbeen observed on all structural levels of muscles, includingintact human muscles (e.g., 47), isolated muscle preparationsactivated through electrical stimulation (23, 25), single intactand skinned ﬁbers (e.g., 46), single myoﬁbrils (38, 39, 64), andsingle sarcomeres and half-sarcomeres (48).
The discovery that passive force enhancement occurs in
single myoﬁbrils and isolated sarcomeres was important inso-far as passive forces in these structures originate virtuallyexclusively from the structural protein titin (4, 38, 49, 51, 54).Therefore, titin (Fig. 3) became the main target for explainingpassive force enhancement properties. There are two primarymechanisms that have been put forward in the literature for
how titin might cause passive force enhancement followingactive muscle stretching. The ﬁrst of these mechanisms is
associated with an activation-induced stiffening of the titinmolecule and the second with a shortening of the free springlength of titin and corresponding increase in its stiffness. Thesemechanisms are discussed brieﬂy below, and the interestedreader is referred to recent reviews for greater detail (20).
Theories
The ﬁrst mechanism of titin-based passive force enhance-
ment is associated with the idea that titin becomes stifferupon activation and when stretched actively produces agreater “passive” force compared with when a muscle isstretched passively. These increased titin stiffness and forceare then maintained when the muscle is deactivated, thusproducing the passive force enhancement. The most obviousway that titin stiffness might be increased upon muscleactivation (i.e., the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmicreticulum and the increase in calcium concentration near thecontractile ﬁlaments actin and myosin) is if one assumesthat, upon activation, calcium binds to speciﬁc sites on titin,thereby increasing the number or strength of molecularbonds that must be broken when an active muscle (and thustitin) is being stretched. Labeit et al. (44) were the ﬁrst toprovide compelling evidence that calcium activation insingle ﬁbers increases titin-based stiffness and force insingle molecule and single skinned ﬁber experiments. Spe-ciﬁcally, they showed that calcium activation of skinnedﬁbers, in which actin-myosin interactions were inhibitedwith 2,3-butanedione monoxime, showed signiﬁcantly in-creased titin-based force compared with ﬁbers that werestretched passively (in the absence of calcium). Molecularexperiments using the functionally relevant PEVK region oftitin (Fig. 3) showed that E-rich motives in this region boundcalcium and increased the stiffness of the PEVK segment.These results were conﬁrmed by later experiments in singlemyoﬁbrils (38, 39) and single sarcomeres (48).
Titin contains a large number of repeat immunoglobulin
domains (Fig. 3) that make up a substantial part of thisprotein’s length and molecular weight. Although the func-tional role of the immunoglobulin domains of titin is notclear and their physiological signiﬁcance is widely debated(7, 18, 19, 40, 55, 67), their abundance makes them aninteresting target for calcium binding and associated stiff-ness changes. We used recombinant techniques to obtaineight tandem I27 cardiac titin immunoglobulin domains anddetermined their capacity for binding calcium with ﬂuores-cence spectroscopy (9). Once satisﬁed that these immuno-globulin domains bind calcium, we tested their unfoldingstrength and found that in the presence of calcium the forcerequired to unfold and stretch these domains was ~20%greater than in the absence of calcium (Fig. 4) (9). Theseresults suggested that, indeed, immunoglobulin domains canbind calcium upon muscle activation, thereby increasingtheir unfolding strength and making titin stiffer in theactivated state (presence of calcium) compared with thenonactivated, passive state (absence of calcium). However,when calcium was removed from the immunoglobulin en-vironment, calcium bound to the I27 domains was released,

was stretched by 9 mm. B: passive force enhancement (like the total residual
force enhancement) increases with increasing stretch magnitudes. The 9-mmstretch of the activated soleus muscle produces more force enhancement andpassive force enhancement (difference between yellow and red lines at 12 s)than the 3-mm stretch (difference between yellow and blue lines).1784 PASSIVE FORCE ENHANCEMENT IN MUSCLE

and the effect of calcium binding was reversed. Therefore,
one would expect that upon deactivation of a muscle, and itsassociated removal of calcium from the titin environment,the increased titin stiffness achieved upon activation shouldbe transient and reversed upon deactivation.
Calcium has been shown to bind to areas of titin other
than just immunoglobulin domains [for example, the gluta-mate-rich region of the PEVK segment; Labeit et al. 2003(44)]. However, it has not been shown whether calciumbinding to areas other than the I27 domain is reversible.When myoﬁbrils are stretched at low (resting) and at high(active) calcium concentrations (and in the absence of cross-bridge binding achieved by troponin C deletion) differencesin titin-based forces persist (39), but when calcium isremoved titin-based forces are indistinguishable betweenthe two conditions, suggesting that the effect of calciumbinding is reversed not only for titin’s immunoglobulindomains but for all calcium binding sites on titin, with noapparent effect on titin force. Consequently, it appears thatcalcium binding to titin is not a good candidate for explain-ing the passive force enhancement in striated muscles.Rather, calcium binding to titin and its associated mechan-ical implications appear to be a transient phenomenon thatexists only in the presence of calcium, that is, when themuscle is activated, but not when the muscle is deactivated(passive).
In summary, these ﬁndings of calcium binding to immunoglob-
ulin domains of titin, and corresponding increase in force requiredto extend these domains, led to the hypothesis that calcium
binding to titin contributes to the total residual force enhancementobserved in muscles after active stretching but does not contribute

to the passive force enhancement observed after deactivation of an
actively stretched muscle.
Aside from calcium binding, titin has been found to change
its inherent stiffness in a variety of other ways. For example,protein kinase G and A have been found to modulate cardiacpassive stiffness by phosphorylation of titin (41, 42). There-fore, it has been suggested that titin is a molecular springwhose stiffness can be changed in a variety of ways and thatsome of these changes can be produced by muscle activation(20, 22, 26, 68).
The second mechanism by which titin has been thought to
contribute to the residual force enhancement property of stri-ated muscle is a shortening of its effective spring length (e.g.,21, 22). Titin runs from the center of the sarcomere along thethick ﬁlament to which it is “ﬁrmly” bound. It then runs freelyacross the I-band segment of the sarcomere and inserts into thethin, actin, ﬁlament ~50 –100 nm away from inserting into theZ band (73, 74). It has been suggested that titin’s free springlength in the I-band region could be shortened readily byfurther attachment of titin to the “rigid” actin ﬁlament, therebyrendering the proximal (bound) titin segments inextensible andjust leaving the distal (unbound) segments for elongation (e.g.,27). Titin has been found to bind to actin in vitro (2, 5, 8, 43,50, 52, 53, 61, 73, 75), thus providing support for this theory.However, direct evidence for titin binding to actin in intactmuscles remains elusive.
In recent experiments (9a), we divided titin into separate
segments using ﬂuorescently labeled, titin-speciﬁc antibodiesin rabbit psoas myoﬁbril preparations. We then stretched thesemyoﬁbrils passively (pCa /H110058.5) and actively (pCa /H110053.5).
During passive stretching from average sarcomere lengths of1.8/H9262m to average sarcomere lengths of 4.0 /H9262m, all labeled
titin segments elongated as one would expect based on theirstiffness properties. However, during active myoﬁbril stretch-ing, proximal segments were only elongated for part of thestretch cycle and then remained at a nearly constant length
(Fig. 5). Elongation stopped at sarcomere lengths where theproximal segments had not reached their fully extended length.I interpreted these results as showing that the proximal titinsegment had bound to actin and thus elongation of the boundsegment stopped while all sarcomere (and associated I band)elongations were taken up exclusively by the free distal seg-ments of titin (Fig. 5). If proximal titin segments indeed bindto actin when an active muscle is stretched, titin’s free springlength that can be used to accommodate sarcomere elongationswould be shortened and thus would be stiffer and produce moreforce upon stretching compared with a passively stretched
muscle where the entire titin length is available for accommo-dating sarcomere length changes.
Residual force enhancement and passive force enhancement
in single myoﬁbrils activated with calcium while cross-bridgeattachment is completely inhibited (for example, with 2,3-butanedione monoxime or troponin C deletion) are negligible(49) or small (38, 39, 64). However, when cross-bridge inter-actions are allowed, force enhancement and passive forceenhancement are substantial, with passive forces that canincrease up to a factor of four for certain conditions in activelycompared with passively stretched myoﬁbrils (48, 49, 64).These results suggest that residual force enhancement andpassive force enhancement do not rely (much) on activation(calcium) but rely in some way on active, cross bridge-basedforce production. Since calcium binding to titin seems to betransient and reversible (9, 44), and thus is not expected to playa role in passive muscle, passive force enhancement is likelynot a calcium (activation)-dependent property. Rather, titinbinding to actin (or some other structural sarcomere compo-nent), which seems to depend on strongly bound cross-bridgeconﬁgurations, appears to be a more likely candidate for thepassive force enhancement properties in striated muscle.
Fig. 5. Titin segmental elongations as a function of sarcomere lengths. Titin is divided into a proximal (close to the Z band) and a distal (close to myos in) segment
by a ﬂuorescently labeled antibody in the PEVK domain. For passive stretching (not shown), the distal and proximal segments elongate continuously wh en
sarcomeres are stretched and sarcomere length increases. During active stretching shown here, the proximal segment of titin only elongates for part of the
sarcomere stretching and then stops elongating. This occurs at a sarcomere length of ~3.0 /H9262m for the particular myoﬁbril shown here as an example from /H11022120
experiments. In other myoﬁbrils, titin proximal segment elongation stopped occurring at sarcomere lengths ranging from 2.2 to 3.4 /H9262m, and this occurrence
seemed to depend crucially on the sarcomere lengths at which myoﬁbril activation occurred. When the proximal segment stops elongating, all sarcomer e
elongation is taken up by the distal segment of titin. I interpret this result as showing that titin binds to actin during active stretching. This bindi ng of titin to
actin does not occur through activation (calcium release) but seems to require cross-bridge binding to actin. Therefore, this phenomenon is indepen dent of calcium
and is thought to persist when the muscle is deactivated and calcium is sequestered back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle ﬁbers.1786 PASSIVE FORCE ENHANCEMENT IN MUSCLE

In light of these ﬁndings, I propose the following tentative
theory for passive force enhancement (Fig. 6). When a muscleis actively stretched (eccentric muscle action), strong cross-bridge binding to actin results in a conﬁgurational change ofthe regulatory proteins tropomyosin and troponin. This conﬁg-urational change, in turn, exposes titin attachment sites onactin. Some proximal (toward the Z band) segments of titin(the exact segments need to be determined) bind ﬁrmly toactin, thereby leaving only the unbound (distal) titin segmentsfor accomplishing the increases in I-band length with increas-ing muscle (sarcomere) length. This binding of titin to actinresults in increased titin-based forces in the actively stretchedmuscle. When the muscle is deactivated, titin remains attachedto actin, thereby providing a long-lasting increase in passivemuscle force: the passive force enhancement observed afterdeactivation of an actively stretched muscle. This passive forceenhancement is typically smaller than the total residual forceenhancement, presumably because upon muscle deactivationcalcium bound to titin is released and the associated increase instiffness is lost. However, deactivation of isometric muscles isassociated with a lengthening of ﬁbers and sarcomeres, andassociated lengthening of titin, which may lead to an overes-timation of the passive force enhancement, reaching valuesequal to or greater than the residual force enhancement (forexample in Fig. 1) for some exceptional experimental condi-tions. Passive force enhancement diminishes slowly and is lostwithin ~3– 4 min (in cat soleus muscles; unpublished observa-tion). However, passive force enhancement can be abolishedinstantaneously if a muscle is quickly shortened from itsstretched position (25), suggesting that there is a mechanical“release mechanism” for titin bound to actin.
SUMMARY
Passive force enhancement is observed after deactivation of
an actively stretched (eccentric action) muscle. The origins ofthe passive force enhancement remain unknown. However,there is compelling evidence that the passive force enhance-ment is associated with the structural, ﬁlamentous protein titin.I propose tentatively that passive force enhancement is notactivation (calcium) dependent but depends crucially on forceproduction in eccentric muscle action by actin-myosin-basedcross bridges. Speciﬁcally, I hypothesize that strong cross-bridge binding results in a conﬁgurational change of troponinand tropomyosin that frees up attachment sites for titin onactin. Titin then binds to actin, thereby shortening its freespring length and making itself stiffer, thus increasing titin-based force when a muscle is stretched. Upon deactivation,titin remains bound to actin but can be released immediately,and all passive force enhancement is abolished, when themuscle shortens quickly from its stretched length.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The hypotheses proposed above about the function of titin in
active and passive muscle, and particularly the proposed mech-anism for the passive force enhancement property, may appearfar-fetched. However, there are mechanisms for passive forceproduction in animal systems that have been shown to work ina way similar to that proposed above for titin in passive forceenhancement. For example, in muscles of mollusks there is atitin analog called twitchin. Twitchin is a titinlike protein that
Fig. 6. Proposed mechanism for the passive force enhancement property of
skeletal muscle. In the initial condition, the sarcomere is short and in the passivestate ( A). If stretched passively from that initial conﬁguration, the sarcomere will
become longer and all titin segments are stretched and produce a force inaccordance with the titin properties ( B). If the sarcomere is activated via calcium
but cross-bridge binding to actin is inhibited (for example, by 2,3-butanedionemonoxime or by troponin C deletion) and then stretched, calcium will bind to titin(indicated by the brownish color in C) but titin will not bind to actin. Titin is stiffer
in this conﬁguration because of the bound calcium. If the sarcomere is stretchedwhile activated and cross-bridge forces are allowed to develop (normal activationand force production, eccentric muscle action), titin will bind calcium and willbind to actin (I propose somewhere in the PEVK region), and will produce moreforce than in C, because of the titin binding to actin that is made possible by the
cross-bridge binding to actin ( D). When the actively stretched muscle (in which
cross bridges were allowed to bind to actin) is now deactivated, calcium is releasedfrom titin and titin will remain bound to actin, thereby producing the passive forceenhancement observed in skeletal muscles after stretching of an activated muscle(E). If now, in the deactivated state, the muscle is quickly shortened to its initial
length and immediately stretched back to its original length (indicated by doublearrow in F), titin is released from actin and the passive force enhancement is
immediately abolished, while without this quick shortening-stretch cycle, thepassive force enhancement would persist for minutes.1787 PASSIVE FORCE ENHANCEMENT IN MUSCLE

has been shown to form connections between actin and myosin
in the so-called catch state of these muscles (3, 13, 70, 71). Inthe catch state, muscles can produce great forces at virtually nometabolic cost and in the absence of calcium (passive muscle)(14). Twitchin attachment between actin and myosin is regu-lated by phosphorylation, the catch state corresponding to thedephosphorylated twitchin state (14). The idea that a passivestructural element engages between actin and myosin whenlong-lasting and great forces are required is intriguing, becausemaintaining such forces with cross bridges would be metabol-ically expensive, whereas attachment and detachment of astructural protein require virtually no metabolic energy. Maybethe passive force enhancement observed in mammalian skeletalmuscle is an evolutionary remnant of the role played bytwitchin in molluscan muscles.
