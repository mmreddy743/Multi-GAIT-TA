Nutritional interventions, such as dietary or calorie restriction, are known tohave a variety of health-promoting effects. The most impressive are the direct
effects on life expectancy, which have been reproduced in many animal
models. A variety of dietary restriction protocols have been described, which
differ either in their macronutrient composition or in the time window for con-
sumption. Mechanistically, the effects of dietary restriction are mediatedmainly through signaling pathways that have central roles in the maintenance
of cellular energy balance. Among these, target of rapamycin and insulin sig-
naling appear to be the most important. Such nutritional interventions can
have their effects in two different ways: either by direct interaction with the
metabolism of the host organism, or by modulating the composition and per-
formance of its endogenous microbiome. Various dietary restriction regimens
have been identified that significantly alter the microbiome and thus pro-foundly modulate host metabolism. This review aims to discuss the mecha-
nisms by which dietary restriction can affect life expectancy, and in particular
the role of the microbiome.

1|INTRODUCTION
Very few dietary interventions have been described that
have undisputed health-promoting effects. Caloric restric-
tion (CR) and dietary restriction (DR) are the most signif-
icant dietary regimens for which such health-promotingeffects have been demonstrated.
1–5These positive effectsinclude an increase in lifespan in a great variety of model
organisms, ranging from yeast to mammals.6The publi-
cation of a plethora of reports claiming a prolongation oflifespan has led to the general perception that CR and/or
DR might also represent a “fountain of youth ”in
humans.
7In the current review, the mechanisms under-
lying the health-promoting effects of DR, especially those
mediated via modification of the intestinal microbiome,
will be discussed.
The terms CR and DR are often used synonymously,
but they represent different nutritional interventions. CR
involves a lower energy intake compared with ad libitum
feeding, whereas DR is a generic term encompassing anyAbbreviations: Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog;

dietary regimen that differs from a conventional diet in at
least one major respect. The reduction in calorie intakeusing CR is usually in the range of 20 –40%, which is
insufficient to cause malnutrition.
8Because the purpose
of CR is a reduction in energy intake, the amount of foodconsumed is lower, but the composition of the diet is
usually unaltered. By contrast, “DR”can signify a very
broad range of dietary regimens that differ from conven-tional diets with respect to at least one major compo-
nent.
8Thus, CR can be understood as a particular subset
of DR. Because a plethora of different nutritional regi-mens can be summarized under the umbrella term“DR,”its definition is fairly vague, and uncertainty in
the meaning of the term is further increased by differing
understandings of what a conventional, normal, or con-trol diet is. This means that direct study-to-study com-
parisons can be difficult, which at least partly explains
the challenges encountered in reproducing publishedfindings.
2|CR, MACRONUTRIENT
RESTRICTION AND TIME
RESTRICTED FOOD INTAKE
In addition to CR, which can be described as the mother
of all dietary interventions, other DR protocols are of
particular interest. Macronutrient restriction and restric-tions in food availability are DR regimens that have
repeatedly been shown to prolong lifespan. Numerous
different diets that are restricted with regard to particu-lar macronutrients have been described, but those char-
acterized by substantially lower protein content are of
particular interest because they have been reproduciblyassociated with longer life.
9–11Indeed, it has been
hypothesized that the beneficial effects of CR on lifespan
can be attributed mainly to the associated reduction in
protein intake11,12; however, this view has recently been
challenged.13Nevertheless, studies performed in a num-
ber of animal species have shown that protein restric-
t i o ni n c r e a s e sb o t hl i f e s p a na n dh e a l t h yl i f e s p a n ,implying that these effects involve evolutionarily con-
served mechanisms that might also be operational in
humans.
14,15The positive effects on lifespan achieved
using diets with low protein or amino acid content can
also be achieved by reductions in specific amino acids,
with substantial restriction of methionine beingmost effective.
5,15 –19Moreover, this reduction in methio-
nine levels changes the cellular metabolism and has a
supportive effect in cancer treatment.20Depending
on the organism under investigation, the experimentalconditions must be carefully controlled to permit study-
to-study comparisons; however, this can be a majorproblem, especially in studies employing mammals, and
will be discussed later.
2.1 |Time-restricted food intake
The second major type of DR that is associated with a
positive effect on lifespan is time-restricted feeding.Time-restricted feeding regimens typically employ one of
two simple approaches: a reduction in overall caloric
intake, achieved by reducing or preventing food intakefor a period of time, or an effort to benefit from theadvantages of DR or starvation while not following a
strict, lifelong diet. Thus, as for macronutrient restriction,
a large number of different nutritional regimens can besummarized under the umbrella of “time-restricted feed-
ing.”In practice, starvation (no food intake), CR, or DR
are applied for defined time periods, which are usuallyrepeated. Although starvation is an extreme form of DR,
the effects of starvation, CR, or DR during these time
periods may be dissimilar, although a systematic compar-ison of the effects of each has yet to be performed.
Time-restricted feeding or intermittent fasting
involves repeated periods of starvation. In flies, therestriction of food intake to 12 hr per day, which resultsin a daily 12 hr fast, is sufficient to ameliorate the age-
associated decline in cardiac function.
21Other daily
recurring regimens include the 16:8 diet, in which feed-ing is restricted to an 8 hr period daily. The application of
these types of intermittent fasting has been shown to
improve a number of health-related parameters inhumans
22and increase lifespan in mice.23In addition to
this seemingly minor prolongation of the normal daily
phase of fasting, the effects of longer periods of starvationhave also been studied. The most notable of these are theevery-other-day diets, in which 1 day of ad libitum feed-
ing alternates with 1 day of fasting. Although this type of
time-restricted food intake is associated with improve-ments in health,
24–26its effects on lifespan are inconsis-
tent.27In contrast to the inconsistent results achieved
using this regimen, longer periods of fasting ( ≥48 hr),
or the consumption of a diet that mimics fasting, have
been shown to reproducibly improve numerous health-
associated traits in mice and humans.28,29
Other time-restricted feeding regimens that employ
periods of DR instead of periods of starvation have also
been studied. These approaches are frequently used bypeople aiming to reduce their body weight. In theseinstances, a diet is followed for a certain period of time,
after which the person returns to their normal dietary
regimen. In general, the response of the organism to DRcan be characterized temporally in at least two ways: the
first is the time from which the positive effects of2 VON FRIELING ANDROEDER
DR, CR, or starvation unfold, and the second is the
degree of persistence of these effects, even after a returnto normal food intake. Significantly, a shift at a relatively
late life stage from normal food intake to DR has just as
large an effect as lifelong DR.
1,30,31Furthermore, recur-
rent DR has recently been shown to be as effective as life-
long DR if the periods of DR are of at least 2 –3 days in
length.32However, the underlying molecular mecha-
nisms of these effects are far less well characterized than
those of CR or specific protein restriction. In addition, it
is still not conclusively clarified whether the energy ormacronutrient restriction has the decisive contribution tothe positive effects of CR and/or DR.
2.2 |Energy versus protein restriction as
inducers of lifespan prolongation
Energy and protein restriction have both been identified
as the major mechanisms underlying lifespan extension
in response to dietary interventions. Traditionally,lifespan extension has been attributed to the lower
energy contribution of CR diets.
5However, studies per-
formed in yeast, Drosophila and other invertebrate
models have focused on the importance of reducing theprotein content of the diet,
10and consequently it has
been concluded that protein restriction is the most
important component of a CR regimen for its lifespan-extending effects. However, recent analyses have chal-
lenged this view and claimed that, at least in rodents, it is
the lower energy contribution of a CR diet that is causallylinked to lifespan extension, rather than protein restric-
tion.
13These seemingly conflicting results were obtained
in studies carried out using different models: groupsworking with invertebrates have repeatedly identifiedprotein restriction as causing lifespan extension, whereas
other groups working with rodents have identified energy
restriction as the cause.
9–11,13This has led to the hypothe-
sis that the mechanism of lifespan extension resulting
from nutrient restriction (energy or protein) is not phylo-
genetically conserved.13However, this view has been
contradicted by more recent work demonstrating exten-
sive similarities between vertebrates and invertebrates
with regard to lifespan extension.10
To understand these apparent differences, it is neces-
sary to compare the experimental systems used in more
detail. CR is easy to perform in rodents because theamount of food ingested by the animals can be preciselycontrolled, which makes CR experiments in these larger
model organisms straightforward. However, such an
experimental approach is not possible in invertebratesbecause the amount of food ingested cannot be con-
trolled. Therefore, food dilution has been used to achieveCR, but this approach has severe limitations, for example,
compensatory food ingestion.
13Consequently, the restric-
tion of macronutrients, especially protein, or even spe-
cific amino acids, has been widely used because this can
be more easily managed. CR and DR should interact withmajor sensor systems within cells in different ways.
Whereas CR activates both, energy sensing and protein
sensing systems, DR primarily affects the protein sensingsystems (Figure 1). However, it should be noted that data
interpretation is hampered by the fact that food regimens
are not sufficiently standardized, even for Drosophila .
33
Nevertheless, the early macronutrient restriction models
have evolved into more sophisticated approaches, such as
nutritional geometry,34in which the relative and absolute
amounts of major macronutrients are taken into account.However, these approaches are less frequently used in
rodents and nutritional studies in rodents are associated
with additional limitations that make comparisonsamong laboratories and species difficult. As already
pointed out, a major problem in comparing studies, espe-
cially those dealing with different relative proteinamounts is the lack of standardization. This is a general
problem in this area, but both the protein origin and the
relative amount of protein appear to have a major impacton the experimental results. Proteins from differentsources have either been associated with a positive, a
negative, or no effect on health- and/or lifespan. Proteins
derived from plant sources and from fish appear to havemore positive effects than those from most animals.
35
Furthermore, a reduction in protein content leads to phe-nomena such as food aversion in rodents, which in turncan act as a confounder.
36Last but not least, the case of
the reducing relative protein levels in the diet appears to
induce a biphasic response. During most parts of life, thistype of DR seems to be beneficial as it reduces a numberof disease states and therewith premature death, but for
the very last phases of life, it may be detrimental. Thus,
depending on minor changes in the experimentaldesigns, different outcomes for this biphysic response
might account for major differences in DR experiments
employing protein restriction.
14,36
As previously mentioned, the meta-analysis that
showed that only a reduction in energy intake leads to
lifespan elongation in rodent experiments13has been
challenged by other vertebrate studies, leading to the
reinstatement of the previous view that a reduction in
protein intake is more important than a reduction inenergy intake.
10Thus, it is still a matter of debate
whether energy or protein restriction leads to longer life.
Moreover, the concept that lifespan prolongation
resulting from nutritional restriction is an evolutionarilyconserved phenomenon has been brought into question.
However, on the basis of the most recent studies, theVON FRIELING ANDROEDER 3
authors believe that the seemingly different results
obtained using rodents and invertebrates may be the
result of methodologic, rather than biologic differences.
Therefore, we anticipate that this discussion will con-tinue. Despite these differences between DR and CR, theunderlying molecular frameworks that are responsible
for mediating longer life in response to these interven-
tions share numerous similarities.
2.3 |Molecular mechanisms underlying
the lifespan extension induced by
DR or CR
Studies conducted using a number of different model
organisms, especially yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans ,Dro-
sophila , and mice, have paved the way to an understand-
ing of how DR and CR exert their positive effects onlifespan.
5,37In accordance with the proposition that
energy restriction underpins CR, whereas protein restric-
tion underpins DR, the cellular systems that are directlyinvolved in maintaining energy homeostasis or in sensing
protein (amino acid) status are particularly important.
Specifically, the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target ofrapamycin (mTOR) and insulin/insulin-like growth fac-
tor (IGF)-1 pathways are the primary mediators of the
effects of DR and CR. The most impressive results linkinglonger lifespan with nutritional interventions are thosegenerated by studies of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling path-
way. Age-1, a C. elegans mutant that has a lifespan up to
twice as long as that of control worms, is deficient in pho-sphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).
38Following this initial
finding, a large body of work has been published thatmostly used C. elegans and Drosophila as model organ-
isms, which has found that mutations in components of
the pathways responsible for the activation of forkhead
transcription factors (FoxOs) are associated with longerlifespan.
39,40These studies have placed FoxOs in a central
role with regard to lifespan extension, and the impor-
tance of these transcription factors was further empha-
sized by the identification of FoxO3A as a humanlongevity gene.
41However, FoxOs are not the only medi-
ators of lifespan prolongation because an interaction with
the Ras-extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk)-anterioropen (Aop) arm of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)
pathway appears to be required for this effect.
42,43Taken
together, these findings imply that a reduction in insulinsignaling has a beneficial effect on lifespan, and providesa direct link with interventions such as DR and CR.
In addition to insulin/IGF-1 signaling, other signaling
pathways have also been implicated. Reductions in TORsignaling at various levels have been shown to be directly
linked with longer lifespan in diverse models, ranging
from yeast to mice.
44–47TOR (or mTOR) functions as a
cellular hub that translates information about the energy
status of the cell into a suitable physiologic response. In
general, the pathway is activated by nutrients and isinhibited in response to stressors, including a lack of
specific nutrients. In addition, upstream of TOR is the
energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),which serves as a sentinel and master regulator of cellularenergy homeostasis.
48AMPK regulates TOR activity
through either tuberous sclerosis proteins (TSCs) or rap-
tor, and the kinase Akt, which is central to the insulin/IRS1 pathway, inhibits TSC, thereby also controlling TOR
activity.
49Furthermore, the mTOR complex (mTORC1)
FIGURE 1 Control diets (CD), which are characterized by sufficient energy and macronutrient intake, activate the two most important
cellular nutrient sensor systems, which serve to control the energy status (insulin signaling) and the availability of amino acids (mechanistic
target of rapamycin [mTOR] signaling), to a similar extent.111,112Caloric restriction (CR), which is characterized by a reduced food intake,
leads to a strongly reduced signaling of the energy sensing pathway, but also to a reduced activation of the amino acid sensing pathway(left).
113Dietary restriction (DR), with a reduced protein concentration, leads to a strong reduction of the amino acid concentration and thus
to a strong inhibition of the corresponding amino sensing pathways. The corresponding energy sensors are much less influenced by a DR
with reduced protein amount4 VON FRIELING ANDROEDER
has a direct nutrient-sensing activity, and is particularly
sensitive to amino acid status.50During CR, energy intake
is lower, which on the one hand leads to lower cellular
energy storage, which inhibits TOR activation via AMPK,
but on the other hand downregulates insulin signaling,which reduces TOR activity via Akt.
49The effects of DR,
or more specifically of protein restriction, appear to be
mediated though a reduction in amino acid-inducedmTORC1 activation
50(Figure 2).
To understand the central position of TOR in the reg-
ulation of lifespan and the responses to CR and DR, wemust evaluate its downstream targets in more detail, inparticular ribosomal S6 protein kinase (S6K1/2) and 4E-
BP, a translational repressor that binds the eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E. Active TOR inhibits 4E-BP, thus pro-moting protein synthesis and cell growth, whereas DR
increases 4E-BP activity, which is associated with longer
lifespan.
514E-BP-mediated signaling is a major target of
nutrient-related signals, but also of other stress signals,
which implies that signaling through this pathway may
mediate the effects of various stressors on lifespan.52
Another molecule downstream of TOR is ribosomal pro-
tein S6 kinase (S6K), deficiencies of which are associated
with longer lifespan in mice,53flies,45and worms.54
A reduction in S6K activity leads to a reduction in trans-lation and consequent growth arrest. The relevance ofthese signaling pathways for controlling lifespan has
recently been further. The importance of these signalingpathways for the determination of life span has recently
been confirmed by a combined pharmacological inter-
vention. Three drugs influencing three important signal-ing pathways were used in a Drosophila system, which
led to a dramatic extension of life span.
55
Whereas the roles of insulin and TOR signaling in
lifespan extension seem to be directly linked to DR, the
mechanisms that connect sirtuin activity with longevity
are less clear. Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that linkdeacetylation at lysine residues with NAD hydrolysis.The members of the sirtuin family are present in various
cell compartments, including the nucleus, cytosol, and
mitochondria. Greater sirtuin activity has been linked tolonger lifespan in a number of different studies in yeast,
worms, flies, and mice.
56–60The mechanism likely
involves the effect of nutritional status on cellular NAD:NADH ratio, which determines the activation state of
sirtuins, thereby influencing health and lifespan.
61
Although the effects of sirtuin overexpression are
controversial,62directed sirtuin overexpression in specific
organs of Drosophila induces lifespan prolongation.63,64
Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still not
fully understood. The methylation of nicotinamide seemsto be a major effect of sirtuins that is necessary for
FIGURE 2 Diagram of the most important signaling pathways directly involved in mediating the effects of dietary restriction/caloric
restriction (DR/CR) in life span extension. These signaling pathways are also of central importance for the perception of the energy and
amino acid levels of the cells. In different model systems, the altered activity of the genes listed here could be associated with the change inlife span. CR or DR leads to reduced activation of the respective signaling pathways, which in turn leads to an extension of the life span.
114
This is particularly valid for insulin/IGF1 and the mTOR pathway. In addition, important pharmacologic drugs are shown with their site ofaction in this signal network, the use of which has already led to a prolongation of life. These include resveratrol on the one hand and tripletreatment with trametinib, rapamycin, and lithium on the other.

lifespan extension.65Furthermore, a link between sirtuin
activation and the induction of autophagy has beenestablished in C. elegans , which represents a direct link
between DR and lifespan extension.
66Recent studies rev-
ealed that the full set of mechanisms governing DR medi-ated increases in lifespan is much more complex than
anticipated. In Drosophila mechanisms that govern post-
transcriptional modifications are essential for DR medi-ated lifespan extensions,
67InC. elegans , downstream of
TOR signaling, DR interferes with the innate immune
system to enable lifespan prolongation.68Furthermore,
DR has been shown to improve proteostasis throughimproving ER stress homeostasis.
69Despite the large
number of studies that have shown a positive effect of
DR/CR on health and lifespan, some investigators arguethat these are effects that are restricted to short-lived
organisms, but are not relevant in long-lived organisms.
2.4 |Implications of dietary
interventions in long-lived organisms
Since the seminal study of McCay et al.,4who showed an
increase in lifespan in response to CR in rats, comparablestudies have been performed in a great variety of models,ranging from yeast to mammals.
70,71In rhesus monkeys,
which are long-lived and closely related to humans, two
long-term studies have been performed. Lifelong CR wasshown to have health-promoting effects,
7,72but only one
of these studies showed a CR-associated increase in
lifespan.7,72Reevaluation of these data sets identified dif-
ferences in study design that may explain this disparity,
and supported a positive effect of CR on healthy
lifespan.73In addition, a recent study conducted in a
small primate, the gray mouse lemur, revealed a clearDR-induced positive effect on median lifespan, further
supporting the hypothesis that CR (or DR) also increases
lifespan in primates.
74Furthermore, the health-
promoting effects of CR have been reported a number of
times in humans,2,6but the assumption that a reduction
in energy intake is responsible for the effects of CR havebeen challenged.
71Instead, the ratio of proteins to carbo-
hydrates consumed appears to be more important in the
determination of lifespan.6,14,75,76Taken together, studies
using a great variety of model organisms, including inver-
tebrates, but also primates and humans, have consistently
shown that dietary protein content is a major determi-nant of lifespan.
Despite the ongoing discussions regarding the effects
of DR on lifespan in humans, this type of intervention
has been shown to have a wide range of positive effectson health. Thus, it may be worth considering this inter-
vention as a preventive measure or a component of thetherapy for a number of different conditions, especially
metabolic diseases. This is exemplified by a recent studythat showed a positive effect of DR on type 2 diabetes.
77
The treatment of certain cancers appears to representanother highly promising field for the application of DR-based nutritional interventions.
78,79Finally, specific DR
regimens might also induce long-term improvements in
patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such asAlzheimer's disease.
80Other factors that do not show the
straightforward coupling to dietary habits might also
have an important role in the translation of dietary regi-mens into lifespan prolongation. Among them, themicrobiome takes an outstanding position, as it appears
to act as a mediator that contributes to translate the
effects of dietary changes into physiological responses.
3|DR AND THE MICROBIOME
Dietary interventions affect health and lifespan through
at least two different routes: by directly influencing theactivity of important signaling pathways, such as TOR or
insulin signaling; or indirectly, by influencing the compo-
sition of the microbiome, which in turn affects the host(Figure 3). Nutrition-induced changes in the compositionand functionality of this highly important part of the
holobiont might be of greater than expected importance
for the effects of DR. Gut dysbiosis, which is character-ized by changes in the microbial composition that disrupt
the homeostasis between the host and the microbiome,
has been associated with a range of diseases.
81,82More-
over, gut dysbiosis seems to be intrinsically associated
with biologic aging.83,84Thus, any intervention that helps
maintain a healthy microbiome should also affect theprocess of aging, and thus lifespan. In short-lived modelorganisms, such as the killifish, this hypothesis has been
addressed experimentally. In these animals, dysbiosis is a
major change associated with aging, and the extent of thedysbiosis correlates directly with lifespan. Microbiome
transfer experiments have revealed that the transplanta-
tion of “young ”microbiota into older animals can
increase their lifespan significantly.
85,86Similar observa-
tions have been made in Drosophila : aging-associated
dysbiosis of the microbiome also occurs, and is associatedwith dysplasia of the intestine, which leads to an impair-
ment in barrier function,
87,88an exaggerated immune
response that is the equivalent of an inflammatoryresponse, and a consequent reduction in lifespan.
87How-
ever, these relationships between aging, dysbiosis, and
health or lifespan are not restricted to very short-lived
animals, but have also been shown in rodents. In parti-cular, microbial transplantation from older animals
to young, germ-free (GF) ones induces inflammatory6 VON FRIELING ANDROEDER
responses that mirror “inflammaging. ”89Dietary inter-
ventions that mimic fasting change the microbiota, there-
with enhancing intestinal regeneration and reducingintestinal bowel disease.
90This general idea has further
been employed in mouse models of progeria, where the
premature aging is associated with a dysbiotic micro-
biota. Here, fecal transplantation of a healthy microbiotaincreased lifespan substantially.
91
Studies using Drosophila have revealed that the pres-
ence of a microbiome has different effects in differentphases of life. Whereas being GF can be detrimental dur-
ing early life, it seems to be beneficial during the very late
life.
92Very few studies performed in vertebrates have
addressed the interaction between the presence of amicrobiome and CR. Being GF under normal nutritional
conditions increased lifespan in two studies of mice and
rats,
93,94and CR increased lifespan in animals consuming
a conventional diet, but had no additional positive effect
in GF animals.
In principle, CR and DR should have different effects
on the composition of the microbiome. In CR, the total
energy content of the diet is reduced, whereas in many
DR experiments, only protein content is restricted.Although these two interventions would be expected to
have different effects on both the microbiome and host,
there have been no comprehensive assessments of theimportant interplay between nutrition, the microbiome,and health. Nevertheless, some recent studies have
assisted with our understanding of the mechanisms
involved. As already discussed, the TOR pathway isinvolved in the mechanism of lifespan extension induced
by DR.
44It has been shown in GF Drosophila that theintestinal microbiome regulates the expression of compo-
nents of the TOR and insulin signaling pathways.95GF
fly larvae fed a protein-restricted diet show a delay indevelopment compared with conventionally reared ani-mals. Interestingly, recolonization with a single bacterial
species, in this case Lactobacillus plantarum , was suffi-
cient to restore normal development,
96and this positive
effect was critically dependent on TOR signaling.96In
mice, pharmacologic interference with TOR signaling
using metformin, resveratrol, or rapamycin leads tochanges in intestinal microbial communities,
97which
implies that TOR signaling itself affects the intestinal
microbial composition. Overactivation of mTORC1 inmice suppresses the differentiation of intestinal gobletcells, which are responsible for mucus production,
98and
lower mucus production is known to alter the microbial
composition.99The hypothesis that intestinal TOR signal-
ing has a central role in controlling the microbiome was
further supported by studies in Drosophila ,i nw h i c ht h e
feeding of a yeast-restricted diet (DR) reduces mortality fol-lowing oral infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Inter-
estingly, antimicrobial peptides were more abundant after
infection in flies subjected to DR than in controls, and theDR phenotype could be fully recapitulated in flies fed a
normal diet by rapamycin treatment. Myc, a target of the
TOR pathway, appears to mediate these effects of alteredTOR signaling on the expression of antimicrobial peptides,and thus on the composition of the microbiome.
100
In some animal models, metformin, which is used for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has been used as a DRmimetic, and it reproducibly increases lifespan.
101This
positive effect of metformin has been shown in
FIGURE 3 Schematic representation of the interaction between diet, microbiome and host. The food directly influences both the host
and the microbiome. In both cases, the ingested food provides both the required energy and the building blocks for biosynthesis. The
microbiome directly influences the host by providing metabolites, energy, and components for the host. The host, in turn, influences the
microbiome by providing different, energy-rich resources and provides a habitat for the microbiome, but at the same time stronglyinfluences their composition through its own immune system. In particular, this complex interplay between diet, microbiome, and host is
responsible for dietary restriction/caloric restriction (DR/CR) mediated life span extensionVON FRIELING ANDROEDER 7
C. elegans , in which a direct interaction with the micro-
biome appears to be responsible. Metformin inhibits thebacterial folate cycle and methionine metabolism, which
reduces the supply of bacterially derived methionine to the
host, and might explain its effects because the restriction ofmethionine alone also increases lifespan.
15,101Further-
more, DR of tryptophan partially mimics protein restric-
tion, prolonging lifespan in rodents and C. elegans ,102,103an
effect that may be mediated by the increase in bacterial
diversity induced by tr yptophan restriction.104However,
whether such changes in the microbial community medi-ate the effects of single amino acid restriction on lifespanremains to be determined.
Intermitting fasting is a very interesting type of DR
that prolongs lifespan and has positive effects on healthand metabolism.
6,105These positive effects include resis-
tance to bacterial infection, as demonstrated by an
improvement in the clearance of Salmonella typ-
himurium in mice.106The wide range of health-
promoting effects of intermittent fasting also includes the
amelioration of various metabolic diseases associatedwith obesity. The importance of the microbiome in this
has been shown by experiments conducted in GF mice,
in which positive effects of intermittent fasting on obesitywere not observed,
107leading to the conclusion that
intermittent fasting ameliorates obesity in mice by
influencing the intestinal microbiome. Indeed, fecal
transplantation from intermittently fasted mice to GFmice promotes beige fat development, which has an anti-
obesity effect. Furthermore, in a mouse model of experi-
mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, intermittentfasting leads to lower demyelination and disease inci-
dence. The transfer of the intestinal microbiome from
mice that are fed intermittently to GF mice amelioratesthe encephalomyelitis of mice fed a normal diet.
108
Specifically, at the phylum level, intermittent fasting
leads to a shift in the bacterial community from the phy-
lum Bacteroidetes to the phylum Firmicutes. The intestinalmicrobiome of intermittently fasted mice shows an increase
in bacterial diversity and an enrichment of Bacteroidaceae,
Lactobacillaceae, and Prevotellaceae.
108These effects on
the microbiome are also associated with increases in the
number of goblet cells and intestinal mucus production.109
Taken together, these findings show that DR and CR
exert their positive effects on health and lifespan through
various ways, through interaction with specific signaling
systems of the host, and through modification of themicrobiome. Moreover, these two ways of actions arehighly interconnected, which complicates the dis-
entangling of direct from microbiome-mediated effects.
Beside focusing on the host signaling systems, targetedalterations in the intestinal microbial community could
contribute to the improvements in health induced by DRand that the transplantation of a “healthy ”microbiome
represents a promising therapeutic approach for severalmetabolic disorders.
110DR and CR might help to rejuve-
nate the microbiome, thereby eliminating the negative
effect of an aging microbiome on organismal health, thusrepresenting a major mechanism how these nutritional
regimens translate into longer life.
4|OUTLOOK
Our understanding of the effects of DR and its underlying
mechanisms has improved substantially over the last
years. Nevertheless, a number of very important ques-
tions remain unanswered and await being resolved. Oneof the most important tasks for the future is to show how
the findings of DR research can be transferred into the
daily lives of potential users. Which forms of DR are bestsuited for which groups of people? Are there significant
costs associated with DR? These are just some of the ques-
tions that should be better understood when transformingDR concepts into daily routines. In addition to these
application-oriented questions, some very important mech-
anisms have still not been finally clarified. These includethe differentiation between CR and DR, and the mecha-nisms underlying a long-lasting effect of CR/DR. A better
understanding of the significance that epigenetic modifica-
tions play could be very helpful in this context? The use ofnewly developed DR mimetics and the directed manipula-
tion of microbiota could be further starting points for the
application of these concepts in humans.
