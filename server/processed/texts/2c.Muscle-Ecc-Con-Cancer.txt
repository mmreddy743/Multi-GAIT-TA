ABSTRACT  
Introduction : This study investigate d the magnitude and etiology  of neuromuscular fatigue and 
muscle damage induced by eccentric cycling compared to conventional concentric cycling in 
patients with breast cancer.  Metho ds: After a gradual familiarization  protocol for eccentric 
cycling,  nine patients with  early -stage breast cancer performed three cycling sessions in eccentric 
or concentric mode. The eccentric cycling session (ECC) was compared to concentric cycling 
sessio ns matched for power output (CON power, 80% of concentric peak power output, 95±23W) 
or oxygen uptake ( CONV̇O2, 10±2mL.min.kg-1). Pre - to postexercise changes (30s through 10min 
recovery ) in knee extensor maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC), voluntary activatio n, 
and quadriceps potentiated twitch force (Q tw) were quantified to determine global, central, and 
peripheral fatigue, respectively. Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
activities were measured in the plasma before and 24h postexercise as markers of muscle 
damage.  Results : Compared to CON power (-11±9%) and  CONV̇O2 (-5±5%), the ECC session 
resulted in a greater decrease in MVC ( -25±12%) postexercise ( P<0.001). Voluntary activation 
decreased only in  ECC ( -9±6% postexercise,  P<0.001). The decrease in Q tw was similar 
postexercise between ECC and CON power (-39±21% and -40±16%,  P>0.99) but lower in CONV̇O2 
(P<0.001). The CON power session resulted in twofold greater V̇O2 compared to the ECC and 
CONV̇O2 sessions ( P<0.001). No change in CK or LD H activity  was reported from preexercise to 
24h postexercise.  Conclusion s: The ECC session induced greater neuromuscular fatigue 
compared to the concentric cycling sessions without generating severe muscle damage. ECC is a 
promising exercise modality for counteracting neuromuscular maladaptation in patients with 
breast cancer.  ACCEPTED

INTRODUCTION  
In oncology, exercise is considered a medicine (1) for fighting treatment -related side 
effects, such as skeletal muscle deconditioning (2) and exacerbation of neuromuscular fatigue 
(3,4) . However, contrasting results and mode rate benefits of exercise interventions on physical 
condition have been reported in patients with breast cancer (5–7). These discrepancies are likely 
explained by the a bsence of specific exercise guidelines for each cancer type (8,9) , leading to the 
large diversity of exercise modalities, intensities, durations, and frequencies utilized in clinical 
studies (10). 
 
Given the need to counteract severe neuromuscular alterations in the face of documented 
exercise intolerance from breast cancer diagnosis to the end of chemotherapy treatment (11,12) , 
eccentric cycling may be an exercise modality of particular interest in this population. Indeed, 
exercise in the eccentric mode (i.e., lengthening contractions) is characterized by greater force 
product ion per muscle fiber , resulting in lower muscle activation and metabolic demand for a 
given power output than in the concentric mode (13). Therefore, eccentric cycling drastically 
reduces metabolic demand compared to conventional concentric cycling, which offers an 
opportunity to increase muscle mechanical stimuli (14–16), and in fine , the neuromuscular 
training stimul i. 
 
To date, no study has investigated the effects of eccentric cycling in patients with b reast 
cancer. Although the cardiorespiratory , circulatory  and neuromuscular  responses to eccentric 
versus concentric cycling exercise have been previously described in healthy participants (14,16 –
18), the consequences of eccentric cycling on neuromuscular fatigue etiology  are not ACCEPTED
documented in patients with breast cancer . Given the pivotal role of neuromuscular fatigue in 
subsequent training -induced neuromuscular adaptations  (19–21), it is necessary to identify the 
magnitude and etiology  of neuromuscula r fatigue, which can occur from a central origin (i.e., a 
failure of the central nervous system to voluntarily activate the muscle) (22) and/or peripheral 
origin (i.e., structural and biochemical changes within the active muscle leading to an attenuated 
force response to neural output) (23). The consequences of eccentric cycling might differ in 
patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy compared to their healthy counterparts 
because of their strong physical de conditioning (2) resulting from  muscular (24,25)  neural (3,4)  
and cardio respir atory (11) limitations . 
 
While eccentric cycling offers unique and interesting characteristics,  including by leading 
less pain and perceived effort when perf omed at similar power output (18),  lengthening of 
contracting muscle fibers  can induce muscle damage associated with severe local inflammation 
(26–28). In patients with breast cancer, it is critical to limit the systemic consequences associated 
with severe muscle damage in this vulnerable population (29). Interestingly, muscle soreness and 
damage can be prevented by familiari sation sessions to eccentric cycling (30). Thus, muscle 
soreness and damage induced by an eccentric cycling session need to be investigated in patients 
with breast cancer to evaluate its safety and fe asibility before its implementation in a training 
program.  
 
The present study aimed to investigate  the magnitude and etiology  of neuromuscular 
fatigue and muscle damage induced by eccentric cycling exercise, compared to conventional 
concentric cycling, in p atients with early breast cancer. To achieve these goals, eccentric and ACCEPTED
concentric cycling exercises were performed at either similar power output, matching mechanical 
stimuli but leading to different metabolic demands or at similar oxygen consumption leve l (V̇O2), 
matching metabolic demands but leading to different mechanical stimuli . We hypothesized that 
eccentric cycling induces greater neuromuscular fatigue than concentric cycling performed at 
similar power output or V̇O2.  
 
METHODS  
Patients  
Nine women from the Institute of Cancerology Strasbourg Europe (ICANS) were 
included in the present study (NCT05166148). All patients provided written informed consent 
prior to enrolment, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
and received approval from the National Ethics Committee (2021 -A01624 -37). The inclusion 
criteria were as follows: French -speaking, nonpregnant, ≥18 years old, Scarff‐Bloom‐Richardson 
grade I –III, early -stage breast cancer, and a World Health Organization (WHO ) performance 
status of 0 -2 within one year after completion of (neo)adjuvant taxane -based chemotherapy. 
Women were excluded if they had psychiatric, musculoskeletal, or neurological disorders. The 
patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.  
 
Experimenta l design  
Each patient performed 10 visits at the Cancerology Institute within a period of 5 weeks.  
 
𝑽̇O2max assessment.  Patients performed an incremental cycle ergometer test until exhaustion, 
which has been validated in breast cancer patients (31), to determine maximal oxygen uptake ACCEPTED
(V̇O2max) and concentric peak power output. After a 2 -min warm -up at 25 W and 60 rpm, the 
exercise intensity reached 40 W and was increased by 10 W every minute until exhaus tion. After 
a 10 -min recovery period, a second constant test (105% of peak power at 60 rpm) until 
exhaustion was then performed to ensure that the patients reached V̇O2max (32). The mean 
duration  of the incremental and the cons tant tests were 9.2 ± 2.6 min and 2.3 ± 0.3 min, 
respectively.  If the difference in V̇O2 between the incremental test and the constant test was ≤ 2.1 
mL.min.kg, the V̇O2 was considered to be maximal (33). For every pati ent, the differences in 
peak V̇O2 between the incremental test and the constant test were equivalent  (23.4 ± 6.0 
mL.min.kg-1 vs. 23.8 ± 5.7 mL.min.kg-1, respectively; P < 0.001 for equivalence test ). 
 
Familiarization sessions.  Four visits, separated by 2 -3 days of recovery, were implemented to 
familiarize  the patients with eccentric cycling. Each familiarization  session consisted of three 
bouts of eccentric cycling interspersed with no more than 3 min of passive recovery. Exerci se 
workload and duration were progressively increased within and between familiari zation sessions. 
During visit 1, patients performed three 2 -min bouts of eccentric cycling. Patients were asked to 
apply a low resistance to acquire the specific coordination  required in eccentric cycling. Cadence 
was progressively increased from 40 to 60 rpm during visit 1 and then kept at 60 rpm for all the 
following sessions  (34). During visit 2, patients performed 2 min of eccentric cycling at 50% of 
concentric peak power output, followed by 3 min at 50% of concentric peak po wer output and 3 
min at 60% of concentric peak power output. During visit 3, patients performed 6 min of 
eccentric cycling at 60% of concentric peak power output, followed by 3 min at 65% of 
concentric peak power output and 3 min at 70% of concentric peak power output. During visit 4, 
patients performed 6 min of eccentric cycling at 70% of the concentric peak power output, ACCEPTED
followed by 6 min at 75% of the concentric peak power output and 4 min at 80% of the 
concentric peak power output. After each familiariz ation  session (24 h and 48 h postexercise), 
patients reported thigh muscle soreness (detailed below).  
 
Experimental cycling sessions.  Each patient performed three experimental sessions as follows: 
eccentric, high -intensity concentric, and low -intensity concentric cycling exercise. Each 
experimental session was also associated with assessments 24 h postexercise. Eccentric session 
(ECC) and high -intensity concentric session (CON power) were performed at similar power output, 
fixed at 80% of the concentric p eak power. ECC and low -intensity concentric ( CONV̇O2) sessions 
were performed at similar V̇O2 level. The order of the sessions was pseudorandomized among 
the patients, given that the CONV̇O2session needed to be performed after the ECC session.  
 
Experimental cycling protocol  
 The cycling protocol consisted of three 6 -min cycling bouts separated by 3 min of 
recovery  in order to provide a high -intensity interval training session that is tolerable by our 
population of patients with cancer (35).  
 
All patients carried out the experiment protocol as follows: (1) preexercise assessments, 
(2) exercise task, (3) postexercise assessments, and (4) 24 -h postexercise assessments. Before 
exercise , blood samples w ere collected, and neuromuscular testing was performed (detailed 
below). The cycling sessions were performed on a semirecumbent ergometer both for eccentric 
(Cyclus II – Recumbent, RBM Electronics, Leipzig, Germany) and concentric (Ergoline GmbH, 
Ergoselec t 600, Bitz, Germany) cycling. The seat position of each ergometer was adjusted to ACCEPTED
each patient’s morphology and kept constant during all sessions. Patients were required to 
perform the exercise task, which consisted of three 6 -min cycling bouts at 60 rpm separated by 3 
min of recovery. Neuromuscular function was evaluated during each recovery period at 30 s and 
2 min, as well as postexercise at 30 s, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 24 h.  At the end of each 
exercise bout, the rate of perceived exertion was  evaluated using the Borg CR -10 scale. Blood  
samples (detailed below) were collected 24 h postexercise to estimate systemic muscle damage. 
Muscle soreness (detailed below) was evaluated at 24 h and 48 h postexercise.  
 
Neuromuscular protocol  
Patients were f irst familiarized  with isometric knee extensor contractions and the 
associated experimental procedures. Neuromuscular assessment of the knee extensor muscles 
was conducted before, between, and after the cycling bouts using a standardized set of 
contraction s. In each set, patients performed a 3 -s maximal voluntary isometric contraction 
(MVC), and stimulation was applied both during (superimposed twitch) and 1 s after (potentiated 
resting twitch) each MVC to assess the voluntary activation and contractile pro perties of the knee 
extensors, respectively. For each set, strong verbal encouragement was given. Corticospinal 
excitability was measured immediately after the potentiated twitch. Three transcranial magnetic 
stimulations were delivered during a submaximal voluntary isometric contraction corresponding 
to 20% of each patient’s maximal EMG -RMS output (obtained from MVC). At preexercise, six 
sets separated by 30 s of recovery were used to ensure potentiation. Additional sets were 
performed if the variability of  the MVC exceeded 5%. The same standardized set was used for 
the evaluation of neuromuscular function between bouts and postexercise.

Data acquisition and analysis  
Neuromuscular function  
Force and electromyographic activity . Patients  were tested in a seat ed position with the hip 
and knee joints fixed at 100° and 90°, respectively (where 180° represents full extension), and 
aligned in the frontal axis. The lower right leg was strapped above the ankle to an ergometer 
connected to a calibrated force transduce r (Force sensor kit, Chronojump, Barcelona, Spain). 
Surface electromyography (EMG) recording electrodes (Ag -AgCl, 32x32 mm) were placed over 
the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) 
according to the SENI AM guidelines (36). EMG recordings were bandpass filtered (10 Hz – 1 
kHz) and amplified with an isolated differential amplifier (Octal Bio Amp, AD Instruments, 
Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Electromyographic and mechanical signals were collected 
simultaneously at a sampling r ate of 2000 Hz using LabChart Software (AD Instruments, 
Colorado Springs, CO, USA, Version 8.1.13). Electromyographic muscle activity was recorded 
during MVC and during cycling exercise. Muscle activation of the VL, VM, and RF was 
calculated with the root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signals. During  MVC, the RMS was 
determined over a 500 -ms window surrounding the peak force  and normalized  to the M max 
amplitude ( VL RMS.M max-1, VM RMS.M max-1 and RF RMS.M max-1) to estimate central motor 
drive . During cycling, VL, VM, and RF muscle activation was calculated by the RMS of each 
burst using a custom -made MATLAB software algorithm (MATLAB R2019b, MathWorks, 
Natick, MA, USA). The signal was then averaged every 30 s and normalized to the RMS signal 
recorded during pre exercise MVCs (VL %MVC , VM %MVC , and RF %MVC ). 
 ACCEPTED
Electrical femoral nerve stimulation . A constant -current high -voltage (400 V) stimulator 
(DS7 -AH, Digitimer Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) was used to generate rectangular electrical 
impulses (200 µs) and evoke knee e xtensor contractions from the femoral nerve. The cathode (32 
mm diameter, Valu Trode, CF3200 models, Denmark) was positioned over the inguinal space on 
the femoral nerve, and the anode (90 × 50 mm, Valu Trode, 895240 models, Denmark) was 
positioned in the gluteal fold. A recruitment curve was obtained to determine the optimum 
stimulation intensity. The stimulation intensity was increased  by 10 mA from 50 mA until a 
plateau in the single quadriceps twitch peak force ( Qtw) and compound muscle action potential 
(Mmax) were achieved . The maximal intensity was reached when no improvement in Qtw and 
Mmax was observed despite increasing stimulation intensity. A supramaximal stimulation 
intensity (i.e., 120% of the maximal stimula tion intensity) was then used to guarantee the 
complete recruitment of motor units during all neuromuscular assessments.  
 
Qtw was calculated as the force amplitude between the baseline signal and the highest 
force value of the evoked potentiated twitch. The  following parameters of potentiated resting 
twitch, which are indicators of muscle contractile properties, were also calculated: contraction 
time (CT), which is the time from the start of the contraction to Q tw; half relaxation time (HRT), 
which is the ti me from Q tw to 50% decline in Q tw; and maximal rate of force development 
(MRFD), which is the highest positive derivative of the torque for an interval of 10 ms. 
Voluntary activation was calculated using the amplitude of the superimposed twitch (SIT), and 
Qtw, using the following formula: voluntary activation (%) = [1 – (SIT ÷ Qtw)] × 100. 
 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation . Transcranial magnetic stimulations were generated using a 
magnetic stimulator (Magstim 200², The Magstim  Company Ltd., Dyfed, UK) and a double -cone ACCEPTED
coil (diameter of 130 mm). Intensities are expressed as a percentage and function of the 
maximum output intensity (1.4 T). Stimulations were applied to the left motor cortex to evoke 
motor -evoked potentials (MEPs ) in the right knee extensor muscle with the current flowing 
posteriorly to the anterior direction. The coil position was determined by applying stimulations at 
50% of the maximal intensity during isometric contraction at a constant level of EMG (20% 
EMG -RMS registered from the knee extensor MVC, which corresponds to 28 ± 5% of the 
MVC). The optimal position was determined as the position that elicited the greatest MEP in the 
VL and the lowest in the BF (<15% of the raw VL MEP amplitude) (37); the position was 
marked directly on the scalp with a medical marker fo r reproducibility during the experimental 
session. The stimulation intensity for neuromuscular assessments was determined by the active 
motor threshold method. The active motor threshold was the minimum stimulus intensity that 
produced a minimal EMG respon se (more than 50 µV in three out of five consecutive trials) 
during 20% EMG -RMS isometric contraction. The stimulator intensity was set to 120% of the 
active motor threshold to ensure a clear MEP (37). The MEP peak -to-peak amplitudes were 
measured between the maximum and minimum values . Corticospinal excitability showed great 
reproduc ibility using  three transcranial magnetic stimulations  (preexercise ICC for MEP 
amplitudes in VL: 0.89 [95% CI 0.71 -0.96], VM: 0.90 [95% CI 0.74 -0.97] and RF: 0.91 [95% CI 
0.76-0.98]). The 3 MEP amplitudes  were normalized to the concomitant M max (MEP.cM max-1) for 
the VL, VM, and RF  and averaged together .  
 
Cardiorespiratory assessments.  Gas exchange and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest and 
during each bout of cycling using a portable metabolic cart (Cortex Metamax 3B, Cortex 
Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany). Before each exercise session, the pneumotachograph was ACCEPTED
calibrated with a 3 -L calibration syringe (Model 5530, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, MO). The 
gas analysers were calibrated with reference gases of known O 2 and CO 2 concentrations (15% O 2 
and 5% CO 2). V̇O2 and HR were averaged every 30 s.  
 
Muscle soreness.  Thigh muscle soreness was quantified 24 h and 48 h after the familiarization  
sessions to eccentric cycling and experimental sessions, using a visual analogue scale ranging 
from 0 -10 (where 0 indicates “no pain” and 10 indicates “worst pain imaginable”) aft er three 
standing up from a sitting position on a chair.  
 
Blood parameters.  Venous blood samples were drawn at rest before each exercise protocol 
session and after 24 h. Blood samples were collected in 2 ×4-mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
tubes . The blood samples were  immediately centrifuged (10 min at 2000×g), and the plasma was 
collected and stored at -80 °C. Assessments of creatine kinase (CK) (Sigma‒Aldrich assay kit, 
MAK116) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Sigma‒Aldrich assay kit, MAK066) activi ties 
were subsequently performed in 96 -well plates using a spectrophotometer ( Varioskan LUX, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 
 
Statistical analysis  
The sample size calculation was based on a previous investigation doc umenting the 
decrease in knee extensor MVC after an eccentric cycling session in older adults (38). Assuming 
an effect size of 1.4, an α  risk of 0.05, and a  risk of 0.95, the sample size required was N=9 
(G*power, version 3.1.9.4).  ACCEPTED
All the statistical tests were performed with Statistica  10 (Stat -Soft, Inc., Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, USA), and the graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism version 8 software 
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). The data are presented as the means ± SD. 
The Shapiro‒Wilk test and the Levene test were used  to check for the normality and variance 
homogeneity of the data, respectively. The two-one-sided t -test (TOST) was used to test the 
equivalenc e in peak V̇O2 between the incremental test and the constant test  using a 90 % 
confidence interval . Two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures ( condition × time) were used to 
compare neuromuscular indices using  absolute  data (i.e., MVC, RMS.M max-1, voluntary 
activation, Q tw, CT, HRT, MRFD, M max, and MEP.cM max-1), biomarkers of muscle damage (CK 
and LDH activities ), thigh muscle soreness, and rate of perceived exertion. Three -way ANOVAs 
with repeated measures ( condition × bouts × time) were used to compare muscle activation 
(VL %MVC , VM %MVC , and RF %MVC ) and cardiorespiratory parameters (V̇O2 and  HR) during 
cycling. In particular, statistical analyses of the cardiorespiratory parameters were performed 
during the steady state (i.e., last 3 min of each cycling bout). Multiple comparison analysis was 
performed with Tukey’s HSD post hoc  test when a sig nificant difference was found in the 
ANOVAs.  Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.  
 
RESULTS  
Baseline values and settings for the experimental cycling conditions  
At rest, there were no significant differences among the three experimental cycling 
conditions in neuromuscular indices (MVC, RMS.M max-1 , voluntary  activation , Qtw, CT, HRT, 
MRFD, M max, and MEP.cM max-1), cardiorespiratory indices (V̇O2 and  HR), or plasma biomarkers ACCEPTED
(CK and LDH ) (Supple mental Table 1 , Supplemental Digital Content, Baseline values , 
http://links.lww.com/MSS/D58 ). 
 
By design, the power output was not different between the ECC ( 95 ± 23 W) and 
CON power (95 ± 23 W , P = 0.999 ) sessions but was lower in the CONV̇O2 (29 ± 12 W , P < 0.001 ) 
session. Moreover, V̇O2 were similar between the ECC session (10 ± 2 mL.min.kg-1, 43 ± 8% of 
V̇O2max) and CONV̇O2 session (10 ± 2 mL.min.kg-1, 42 ± 9% of V̇O2max, P = 0.940 ) but were 
greater in the CON power session  (20 ± 5 mL.min.kg-1, 85 ± 7% of V̇O2max, P < 0.001 ). 
 
Neuromuscular fatigue  
The neuromuscular indices are presented Figure 1 and Table 2. A significant condition × 
time interaction effect was found for MVC ( P < 0.001). While significant reductions were 
evidenced in the ECC and CON power sessions ( -25 ± 12% vs. -11 ± 9% 30 s postexercise, 
respectively; P < 0.001 ), MVC remained unchanged compared to preexercise throughout the 
CONV̇O2 session (Figure 1A). The ECC session resulted in a greater decrease in MVC compared 
to the CONV̇O2 and CON power sessions after each bout ( P < 0.001). This greater reduction in 
MVC between conditions persisted during the early recovery period documented from 30 s to 10 
min postexercise ( P < 0.001). Moreover, the MVC remained depressed 24 h postexercise 
compared  to preexercise in the ECC session ( -17 ± 8%, P < 0.001), but it was recovered in the 
CON power session (P = 0.376).  The two -way ANOVA did not reveal any significant effect on VL, 
VM, and RF RMS.M max-1 during MVC.  
 ACCEPTED
A significant condition × time interaction effect was found for voluntary activation ( P < 
0.001; Figure 1B). Voluntary activation decreased only in the ECC session after the third bout of 
exercise, reaching -9 ± 6% at 30 s postexercise and -16 ± 9% at 3 min postexercise ( P < 0.001). 
Voluntary activ ation was fully recovered 24 h postexercise in the ECC session ( P = 0.981).  
 
A significant condition × time interaction effect was found for Q tw (P < 0.001; Figure  
1C). Compared to baseline, the Q tw decreased during exercise in the three cycling conditions (P < 
0.001). Compared to CONV̇O2 session, the ECC session resulted in a greater decrease in Q tw after 
the second and third exercise bouts ( P < 0.001), and this difference persisted throughout the 10 
min recovery period ( P < 0.001). The ECC session resulted in a lower decrease in Q tw compared 
to the CON power session at 30 s after the first bout only ( -17 ± 10% vs. 36 ± 13%, respectively; P 
< 0.001). No difference between the two conditions was found from the second exercise bout to 
the 10 min recovery period (P > 0.889). While the Q tw remained lower than the preexercise value 
24 h after ECC ( -14 ± 7%, P < 0.001), it fully recovered in the CON power (P = 0.940) and 
CONV̇O2 sessions ( P = 0.999). The Q tw properties (i.e., CT, HRT, and MRFD) are provided in 
Table 2.  While only a significant time effect was reported for CT ( P < 0.001), a significant 
condition × time interaction effect was found for HRT ( P < 0.001) and MRFD ( P < 0.001).  
 
The VL, VM, and RF muscle activations during cycling are presented in Figure 2. A 
significant condition × time interaction effect was found for VL, VM, and RF RMS %MVC  (P < 
0.001). The ECC session resulted in lower muscle activation compared to the CON power session 
(VL RMS %MVC , P = 0.008; VM RMS %MVC , P = 0.006; and RF RMS %MVC , P = 0.026) but higher 
muscle activation compared to CONV̇O2 session  (VM RMS %MVC  and RF RMS %MVC , both P < ACCEPTED
0.001). The VL RMS %MVC  and VM RMS %MVC  significantly increased between the first and third 
bouts only in the ECC session ( P < 0.001). A significant condit ion × time interaction effect was 
found for M max in the VL, VM, and RF  (P < 0.001; Table 2). M max decreased only in the ECC 
and recovered 24 h postexercise in the VL, VM, and RF.  
 
A significant time effect was found for corticospinal excitability in the VL  and RF 
MEP.cM max-1 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.019, respectively; Table 2).  
 
Cardiorespiratory responses to exercise  
The cardiorespiratory indices are presented in Figur e 3. A significant condition × time 
interaction effect was found for V̇O2 (P < 0.001; Figure 3A). V̇O2 increased over time from the 
first to the third bout during the three experimental conditions ( P < 0.001).  
 
A significant condition × bout × time interaction effect was found for HR (P = 0.032; 
Figure 3B). The ECC session resulted in a lower HR during exercise compared to the CON power 
session (107 ± 12 bpm corresponding to 64 ± 5% of HR max vs. 143 ± 15 bpm corresponding to 89 
± 4% of HR max) and a higher HR compared to the CONV̇O2session (96 ± 14 bpm corresponding 
to 57 ± 5% of HR max). The HR increased over time from the first to the third bout during the 
three  experimental conditions ( P < 0.001).  
 
Rate of perceived exertion and muscle soreness  
The rates of perceived exertion are presented in Table 3. Significant time ( P < 0.001) and 
condition (P < 0.001) effects were found for the rate of perceived exertion. Compared to the ACCEPTED
ECC session, the rate of perceived exertion was greater in the CON power session ( P = 0.042) but 
lower in the CONV̇O2 session ( P < 0.001).  
 
The thigh muscle soreness is presented in Table 4. A significant condition  effect was 
found for thigh muscle soreness (P = 0.002). The thigh muscle soreness measured 24 h and 48 h 
postexercise was greater in the ECC session than in the CON power (P = 0.002)  and CONV̇O2 (P < 
0.001)  sessions.  
 
Muscle damage  
The plasma biomarker levels are presented in Figure 4. Two -way ANOVA did not reveal 
any significant effects on CK ( Figure 4A) or LDH ( Figure 4B) activity.  
 
DISCUSSION  
The present study investigated the magnitude and etiology  of neuromuscular fatigue 
induced by eccentric cycling exercise (ECC) in patients with early breast cancer. These results 
were compared to those of conventional concentric cycling exercises performed  either at similar 
power output  [matching mechanical stimuli but with different metabolic stimuli ( CON power)] or at 
similar V̇O2 levels  [matching metabolic stimuli but with different mechanical stimuli (CONV̇O2)]. 
Using plasma biomarkers, subsequent muscle damage induced by these exercise sessions was 
quantified. As hypothesized, ECC induced greater neuromuscular fatigue than concentric 
cycling, regardless of matching for power output or V̇O2. Specifically, the gre ater magnitude of 
neuromuscular fatigue in the ECC session was primarily due to central mechanisms. In addition, 
the CK and LDH activities did not change under any of the experimental conditions, indicating ACCEPTED
the efficacy of the familiarization  protocol prio r to ECC in limiting the systemic consequences 
associated with muscle damage in patients with early breast cancer.  
 
Neuromuscular responses to eccentric versus concentric cycling  
The present results demonstrated  that ECC session induced greater neuromuscul ar fatigue 
throughout exercise and up to 24 h postexercise than concentric cycling sessions, including when 
conditions were matched for power output (i.e., ECC vs. CON power, Figure 1), in patients with 
breast cancer . The difference in ‘global’ neuromuscular fatigue ( Figure 1A) between ECC and 
concentric exercises was explained by mechanisms of central origin from 0.5 to 10 min 
postexercise (discussed in the next paragraph, Figure 1B) and by mechanisms of peripheral 
origin 24 h postexercise ( Figure 1C). However, the observation of similar levels of peripheral 
fatigue between the ECC and CON power sessions during the early recovery period (i.e., from 0.5 
to 10 min postexercise) did not necessarily imply a similar etiology . Indeed, the CON power 
sessi on was associated with greater metabolic demand compared to the ECC session, as 
evidenced by greater V̇O2 levels (twofold greater , Figure 3) and greater  muscle activation 
(Figure 2)  recorded throughout the exercise session,  suggesting greater intramuscular metabolic 
perturbation.  In contrast, peripheral fatigue was partially explained by alterations in membrane 
excitability in the ECC session, as evidenced by significant decreases in the quadriceps M max 
(39), and resulting from overstretching of the sarcomeres during lengthening contractions  (26). 
At similar V̇O2, the greater peripheral fatigue observed in the ECC session compared to the 
CONV̇O2 session was explained by the high mechanical constraint  characterizing the eccentric 
contraction mode and leading to structural disruption of sarcomeres (40). Interestingly, ACCEPTED
observation of greater neuromuscular fatigue in ECC compared to CON power in the present study 
contracts with a previous investigation performed in healthy participants (18). This discrepenc y 
between studies might be expla ined by the population of interest but also by the exercise 
duration and intensity that plays an important role in neuromuscular fatigue magnitude and 
etiology (41,42) . This emphasize how the results might be specific, and therefore limited, to its 
characteristics and context.  
 
 In addition to the characterization of the level of neuromuscular fatigue postexercise, the 
present study also documented its kinetics during the 3 cycling bouts . While the decrease in 
‘global’ (MVC) and peripheral  fatigue was quite linear from the 1st to the 3rd bout in ECC, their 
development kinetics were as fast ( MVC) or faster ( Qtw) after the 1st bout in CON power, despite  
no significant change thereafter until the last bout (Figure 1). Th ese result s indicate  that different 
kinetics during exercise can lead to similar values at exercise termination (peripheral fatigue) , 
provid ing important  insights for exercise training pre scriptions.  
 
After a 24 -h recovery period, a significant magnitude of peripheral fatigue remained only 
in the ECC session. Given that M max fully recovered at that time, a failure in membrane 
excitability was excluded, which indicated that factors located be yond the sarcolemma were 
responsible for the reduction in force output (43). More precisely, the reduction in MRFD 
observed at 24 h postexercise in the ECC session suggested alterations in excitation -contraction 
coupling (44). 
 ACCEPTED
Why is central fatigue exace rbated during eccentric cycling compared to power -matched 
concentric cycling?  
The present findings supported central fatigue as a primary cause of the greater 
neuromuscular fatigue observed in the ECC session compared to the concentric cycling sessions. 
Indeed, voluntary activation decreased only in the ECC session, which is support ed by a previous 
study showing central fatigue following eccentric, but not concentric, knee extensor contractions 
in healthy participants (45).  
 
In the present study, voluntary activation was reduced in the ECC session despite no 
change in corticospinal excitability during any exercise condition. This result suggest s that 
inhibition occurred upstream rather than downstream of the mot or cortex (46,47) . This idea is 
also supported by fMRI studies showing differences in cortical activity and brain functional 
connectivity between eccentric and concentric exercises (48). However,  it is important to 
consider that the lack of a net effect on corticospinal excitability did not necessarily imply the 
absence of change (49), which is consistent with studies showing that central alterations also 
occur at the spinal level during eccentric exercise (50,51) . Moreover , when transcranial magnetic 
stimulations were delivered during the cycling exercise, a lower corticospinal excitabililty 
associated with a longer silent period were obse rved in eccentric compared to concentric mode 
performed at the same power output (17). Finally, it is important to note that corticospinal 
excitability was tested in the present study using one stimulation intensi ty pre and post fatiguing 
exercise and not through  an input -output (dose -response) curve (52) that might have been more 
sensitive.  ACCEPTED
The differences in central fatigue b etween eccentric and concentric cycling might be 
explained, at least in part, by greater stimulation of group III/IV muscle afferent feedback, which 
can inhibit VA without any alteration in corticospinal excitability (53,54) . Indeed, group III/IV 
muscle afferents are triggered by various signals, such as thermal, mechanical, metabolic, or 
nociceptive sti muli (55), and they project from skeletal muscles to the central nervous system to 
promote central fatigue during intense exercise in order to restrict peripheral fatigue (56,57) . 
Previous findings have  demonstrated that eccentric exercise is associated with exacerbated core 
and muscle temperature elevation (~+1°) at a given V̇O2 (58) or power output (59) compared to 
concentric exercise.  Importantly, a 1° increase in temperature is sufficient to activate group 
III/IV muscle afferents, as evidenced in animal models (60,61) . Moreover, it was demonstrated 
that an increase in core temperature through out exercise (reaching a peak change of +2°) 
promote central fatigue in humans (62). Additionally, the activation of group III/IV muscle 
afferents is presumably specific t o the contraction mode (63). For example, tendon stretching has 
been shown to activate a different population of mechanosensitive group III muscle afferents 
than isometric contraction in decerebrated cats (64). The role of nociceptive stimuli in triggering 
group III/IV muscle aff erents should also be considered. While the systemic  ECC -induced 
pain/inflammation process is not immediate but delayed from hours to days after exercise 
(65,66) , intramuscular bradykinin and prostaglandin concentrations can increase during exercise 
(67,68) . The increase in the levels of these two proinflammatory hormones, which directly 
activate group III/IV muscle afferents (69,70) , was likely greater during ECC than during 
concentric exercise. In contrast, greater activation of group III/IV muscle afferents due to greater 
metabolic  stimuli (i.e., perturbations) was unlikely given the lower metabolic demand during the 
ECC session compared to the CON power session. Taken together,  although speculative,  ACCEPTED
differences in thermal, mechanical, and hormonal stimuli might explain the greater central 
fatigue observed in the ECC session than in the concentric cycling exercise sessions  and its 
persistence during the early phase of recovery . 
 
Clinical considerations and future directions  
While neuromuscular fatigue is a key stimulus for chronic ad aptations to training (19–
21), the eccentric cycling session, which led to a greater magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue 
postexercise compared to the conventional  concentric cycling sessions, seems to be particularly 
appropriate for counteracting the neuromuscular alterations characterizing patients with early 
breast cancer treated with chemotherapy (2,3) . Moreover, ECC session is associated with greater 
mechanical constraints per skeletal muscle fiber  compared to CON power session (71), as 
evidenced in the present study by the lower muscle activation for a given power output in ECC 
session compared to CON power session (Figure 2). Interestingly, muscle hypertrophy is directly 
stimulated by mechanical constraint per fiber  (72); therefore, ecc entric exercise leads to greater 
development of muscle mass and force than concentric exercise (73–75). Taken together, these 
findings indicate that eccentric cycling is a promising exercise modality in patients with breast 
cancer suffering from skeletal muscle atrophy (12). 
 
While eccentric cycling is often associated with severe muscle damage (26,28,65) , the 
present study showed that gradual familiarization  sessions can minimize this undesirable 
consequence, as evidenced by very low thigh muscle p ain reported by patients 24 h and 48 h 
postexercise (2/10 on a visual analog ue scale). These result s are supported by the findings of a 
previous study performed in healthy participants with muscle soreness assessed 24 h and 48 h ACCEPTED
after eccentric cycling exe rcise (30). Familiarization  sessions likely prevent systemic mu scle 
damage given that repetitions of eccentric contractions have been shown to reduce CK activity in 
a subsequent session and to protect the muscle against lesions induced by the eccentric 
contraction mode (28). The present study revealed no change in CK or LDH activity from 
preexercise to 24 h postexercise in the ECC session, indicating that no major muscle damage 
(i.e., no systemic effect) was induced by the exerci se session (76). This observation is important 
in the context of early breast cancer, as patients are already vulnerable (77), and this 
vulnerability should not be exacerbated with exercise interventions. Interestingly, we 
documented low to moderate ratings of perceive d exertion  in eccentric cycling  (Table 3) , which 
is consistent with a previous study showing less perceived effort exertion in eccentric compared 
to concentric cycling performed at similar power output in healthy participants (18). Moreover, 
the observation of no adverse events throughout the study following ECC session supported the 
feasibi lity and safety of ECC for patients with early breast cancer.   
 
Despite the absence of systemic consequences, it is important to note that the observation 
of an ~17% decrease in MVC suggested local muscle damage (78). While such stimuli may 
trigger muscle adaptations to training (79), this substantial decrease in MVC 24 h post -ECC also 
suggested caution in determining the weekly training frequency for eccentric cycling sessions in 
patients with early breast cancer. The next step will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial 
investigating the chronic effects of an eccentric vs. concentric cycling training program 
prescribed during chemotherapy treatment in patients with breast cancer.  
  ACCEPTED
CONCLUSION S 
The present study conducted in patients with early breast cancer demonstrated that 
eccentric cycling induced greater neuromuscular fatigue than concentric cycling performed either 
at similar power output or at similar V̇O2 level. Specifically, the present f indings supported 
central fatigue as a primary cause of the greater neuromuscular fatigue observed in eccentric 
cycling exercise compared to concentric cycling exercise. When matched for power output, the 
metabolic demand was twofold lower in eccentric com pared to concentric cycling. Moreover, 
eccentric cycling performed after a familiarization  protocol was not associated with the 
development of severe muscle damage in patients with early breast cancer. Taken together, 
eccentric cycling may be an interestin g exercise modality for providing a strong neuromuscular 
stimulus while limiting the implication of impaired cardiorespiratory function characterizing 
patients with breast cancer.
